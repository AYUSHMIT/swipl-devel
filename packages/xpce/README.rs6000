The RS6000 port has been migrated from native cc to use gcc.  It was
tested using gcc-2.4.5 on AIX-3.2.

NOTE:	While linking, the text-symbol __iconv_open was reported
	undefined.  I suspect a bug in /usr/lib/libX11.a which 
	has .__iconv_open as defined and __iconv_open as
	undefined symbol.  As a hack __iconv_open is now defined
	as a dummy function in x11/x11.c.  I don't know when this
	function is called.
