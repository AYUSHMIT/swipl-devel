\chapter{Simple graphics}	\label{sec:graphics}

In chapter~\ref{sec:starting} we introduced the principal predicates of
XPCE.  For the examples we used controllers, because these are
relatively easy to use.  In this section we present the basic graphical
components.  These are more general and therefore can be applied in many
more situations, but they are also more difficult to use.

This section only introduces the basics of graphics in XPCE. See also
\cite{XPCE:draw}. The online manual and the demo programs provide more
information on using XPCE's graphics.


\section{Graphical building blocks}

\index{graphical,window}\index{window,coordinates}%
A \class{window} is the most generic window class of XPCE.  Drawings are
often displayed on a \class{picture}, which is a window with scrollbars.
The drawing area of a window is two-dimensional and infinitely large
(both positive and negative).  The query below creates a picture and
opens it on the screen.

\begin{code}
1 ?- new(@p, picture('Demo Picture')),
     send(@p, open).
\end{code}


The following queries draw various primitive graphicals on this
picture.

\begin{code}
2 ?- send(@p, display, new(@bo, box(100,100))).
3 ?- send(@p, display, new(@ci, circle(50)), point(25,25)).
4 ?- send(@p, display, new(@bm, bitmap('pce.bm')), point(100,100)).
5 ?- send(@p, display, new(@tx, text('Hello')), point(120, 50)).
\end{code}

The result is shown in figure~\ref{fig:graphics}.

\postscriptfig[width=4in]{graphics}{Example graphics}

XPCE's graphics infrastructure automatically takes care of the necessary
repaint operations when graphical objects are manipulated. Try the
following queries to appreciate this:

\begin{code}
6 ?- send(@bo, radius, 10).
7 ?- send(@ci, fill_pattern, @grey25_image).
8 ?- send(@tx, font, font(times, bold, 18)).
\end{code}

XPCE avoids unnecessary repaint operations and expensive computations
involved in updating the screen.  The screen is only updated {\em
after} all available input has been processed or on an explicit
request to update it.  The following code illustrates this.  Running
\mbox{\tt ?- square_to_circle(@bo).} will show the box immediately as
a circle without showing any of the intermediate results.

\begin{code}
:- require([between/3, forall/2]).

square_to_circle(Box) :-
	get(Box, height, H),
	MaxRadius is H // 2,
	forall(between(0, MaxRadius, Radius),
	       send(Box, radius, Radius)).
\end{code}

To get the intended animating behaviour, use `graphical ->flush' to
explicitly force redraw right now:

\begin{code}
:- require([between/3, forall/2]).

square_to_circle(Box) :-
	get(Box, height, H),
	MaxRadius is H // 2,
	forall(between(0, MaxRadius, Radius),
	       (   send(Box, radius, Radius),
		   send(Box, flush)
	       )).
\end{code}


\subsection{Available primitive graphical objects}

An overview of the available primitive graphical classes is most easily
obtained using the Class Hierarchy tool described in
\secref{classhierarchy}.  Table \tabref{primgraphics} provides an
overview of the primitive graphicals.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5in}|p{4in}|}
\hline
\class{arrow}	& Arrow-head.  Normally used implicitly
		  by class \class{line}. \\
\hline
\class{bitmap}	& Visualisation of an image.  Both monochrome and
		  full-colour images are supported. \\
\hline
\class{box}	& Rectangle.  Can be rounded and filled. \\
\hline
\class{circle}	& Special case of ellipse. \\
\hline
\class{ellipse} & Elliptical shape.  May be filled. \\
\hline
\class{arc}	& Part of an ellipse.  Can have arrows.  Can show
		  as \idx{pie-slice}. \\
\hline
\class{line}	& Straight line segment.  Can have arrows. \\
\hline
\class{path}	& Poly-line through multiple points.  Can have
		  arrows.  Can be \idx{smooth}. \\
\hline
\class{text}	& Visualisation of a string in some font.  Can
		  have various attributes, can be clipped, formatted,
		  etc. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Primitive graphical objects}
\label{tab:primgraphics}
\end{table}


\section{Compound graphicals}

Sometimes one would like to combine two or more primitive graphical
objects into a single unit.  This is achieved using class \class{device}.
Below we create an icon, consisting of a bitmap and a textual label
displayed below it.

\begin{code}
9 ?- new(@ic, device),
     send(@ic, display, bitmap('happy.bm')),
     send(@ic, display, text('Happy'), point(0, 64)),
     send(@p, display, @ic, point(250, 20)).
\end{code}

A compound graphical may be treated as a unit.  It may be moved, erased,
coloured, etc.\ by sending a single message to the compound.  Compound
graphicals are normal graphicals and thus may de displayed on other
compound graphicals, resulting in a consists-of hierarchy of nested
graphicals.  See also \secref{vishierarchy}.  The classes related to
compound graphical objects are shown in \tabref{compoundgraphics}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5in}|p{4in}|}
\hline
\class{device}	& Most generic compound graphical object. \\
\hline
\class{figure}	& Subclass of \class{device}, provides clipping,
		  background, containing rectangle, border and the
		  possibility to show a subset of the displayed
		  graphical objects. \\
\hline
\class{format}	& A format object specifies a two-dimensional table
		  layout.  Formats may be associated to graphical
		  devices using `device ->format'. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Compound graphical classes}
\label{tab:compoundgraphics}
\end{table}


\section{Connecting graphical objects}		\label{sec:connection}

\index{graph}%
The primary application domain of XPCE is handling graphical modeling
languages. Drawing in such languages often entails connecting graphical
objects using lines. Instead of adding an instance of \class{line} to
the graphical device at the proper place, it is much better to declare
two graphical objects to be connected. Class \class{connection} provides
for this.

To prepare an object for making connections, the object should first
define \class{handle}{\em s}.  Below is a simple example.  The link
is a {\em reusable} object and therefore defined as a global reference.
See \secref{namedref}. The screendump is shown in \figref{connect}.

\begin{pcecode}
:- pce_global(@in_out_link, make_in_out_link).

make_in_out_link(L) :-
	new(L, link(in, out, line(arrows := second))).

linked_box_demo :-
	new(P, picture('Linked Box demo')),
	send(P, open),
	send(P, display, new(B1, box(50,50)), point(20,20)),
	send(P, display, new(B2, box(25,25)), point(100,100)),
	send(B1, handle, handle(w, h/2, in)),
	send(B2, handle, handle(w/2, 0, out)),
	send_list([B1, B2], recogniser, new(move_gesture)),
	send(B1, connect, B2, @in_out_link).
\end{pcecode}

\postscriptfig{connect}{A connection between two boxes}

If there are multiple handles of the same `kind' on a graphical, a
connection will automatically try to connect to the `best' handle.

The classes related to making connections are summarised in
\tabref{connectclasses}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5in}|p{4in}|}
\hline
\class{connection}	& Subclass of class \class{line}.  A connection
			  can connect two graphicals on the
			  same window that have handles.  The line is
			  automatically updated if either of the
			  graphicals is moved, resized, changed from
			  device, (un)displayed, hidden/exposed or
			  destroyed. \\
\hline
\class{handle}		& Defines the location, nature and name of a
			  connection point for a connection.  Handles
			  can be attached to individual graphicals as
			  well as to their class. \\
\hline
\class{link}		& Defines the generic properties of a connection:
			  the nature (`kind') of the handle at either
			  side and the line attributes (arrows, pen and
			  colour). \\
\hline
\class{connect_gesture}	& Event-processing object (see \secref{recogniser})
			  used to connect two graphical objects. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Classes used to define connections}
\label{tab:connectclasses}
\end{table}

Note that, as class \class{connection} is a subclass of
\class{graphical}, connections can be created between connections. Class
\class{graphical} defines various methods to help reading the relations
expressed with connections and/or refine the generic
\class{connect_gesture}.


\section{Constraints}

XPCE allows the user to specify constraints between pairs of
objects.  In the example above  we would like the text to
be centered relative to the bitmap.  This may be achieved using:

\begin{code}
10 ?- get(@ic, member, bitmap, Bitmap),
      get(@ic, member, text, Text),
      new(_, constraint(Bitmap, Text, identity(center_x))).
\end{code}

Each time either the bitmap or the text changes this constraint will
invoke <-center_x on the changed object and ->center_x with the return
value on the other object.  Class \class{spatial} defines more
general geometrical constraints between graphicals.

Constraints are high-level, but potentionally expensive means to specify
graphical relations.  An alternative is the redefinition of the
->geometry method of (compound) graphical objects.  See \chapref{udc}.


\section{Activating graphicals using the mouse}		\label{sec:recogniser}

\index{event,processing}\index{sensitive}\index{moving graphicals} {\em
Recogniser} objects enable detection of mouse- and keyboard activities.
XPCE defines both primitive and complex recognisers. The first (called
{\em handler}) processes a single event. The latter processes a {\em
gesture}: sequence of events starting with a mouse-button-down up to the
corresponding mouse-button-up. The following example allows us to move
the icon by dragging with the middle mouse button:

\begin{code}
11 ?- send(@ic, recogniser, new(move_gesture)).
\end{code}

The second example allows us to double-click on the icon.  This is a common
way to `open'\index{open,icon} an icon.  In the example we will just
print 'hello' in the Prolog window.

\begin{code}
12 ?- send(@ic, recogniser,
           click_gesture(left, '', double,
			 message(@pce, write_ln, hello))).
\end{code}

The predefined recogniser classes are summarised in
\tabref{recognisers}.  Besides the built-in recognisers, the XPCE/Prolog
library defines various additional ones.  See also \secref{dragdrop}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5in}|p{4in}|}
\hline
\class{handler}		& Binds a single event to a \class{message}. \\
\hline
\class{handler_group}	& Combines multiple recognisers into a single. \\
\hline
\class{key_binding}	& Maps keyboard sequences to commands. \\
\hline
\class{click_gesture}	& Maps a mouse-click to a message.  Allows to
			  specify modifiers (alt/meta, control, shift),
			  button and multi (single, double, triple). \\
\hline
\class{connect_gesture}	& Connect two graphicals dragging from the first
			  to the second. \\
\hline
\class{move_gesture}	& Move graphical by dragging it. \\
\hline
\class{move_outline_gesture} & Move graphical by dragging an outline. \\
\hline
\class{resize_gesture}	& Resize graphical by dragging a side or corner. \\
\hline
\class{resize_outline_gesture}	& Resize graphical by dragging a side or corner
			of the outline. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Recogniser classes}
\label{tab:recognisers}
\end{table}


\section{Summary}

In this section we have introduced some of the graphics capabilities of
XPCE. XPCE's graphics are built from primitive and compound graphicals.
A compound graphical has its own coordinate system in which it can
display any graphical object including other compound objects. Graphical
objects can be connected to each others using a \class{connection}. This
facility makes the generation of graphs relatively simple.  It also makes
it very simple to extract the graph represented by a drawing made by the
user.

Graphical objects are made sensitive to mouse and keyboard activities
by attaching \class{recogniser} objects to them.  XPCE defines standard
recognisers for various complex operations such as moving, resizing,
popup-menu's, linking graphicals and clicking on graphicals.
