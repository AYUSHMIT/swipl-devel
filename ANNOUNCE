SWI-Prolog 5.0.6/XPCE 6.0.6 Summary of changes

SWI-Prolog
==========

    * Be better trapping redefined system predicates.  System predicates
      that were referenced from a predicate before being defined caused
      a silent redefinition.

      NOTE: this may imply programs that redefined system predicates 
      silently this way now trap an error while loading and possibly
      won't work any longer.  In this case you must rename your predicate
      or use :- redefine_system_predicate/1 (not recommended).

    * Crash in PLWIN.EXE using the page up/down buttons.

    * Various problems in the multi-threading version.

    * Performance issues in retract/1 with many clauses around.  Can make
      huge differences!

    * Added downcase_atom/2 and upcase_atom/2.

    * Fixed writing 0-bytes as first byte in write/1 and friends

    * Fixed stack-size handling in qsave_program.

    * Fixed crashing PLWIN.EXE on page up/down

    * Huge performance boost retracting from predicates with many
      clauses.
    
    * Make the system compile on GCC-3


Development Environment
=======================

    * Fixed editor-selection based on $EDITOR

    * Fixed GUI-Tracer and PceEmacs problems wasting stream-handles that
      ultimately make the environment stop functioning.

    * Fixed PceEmacs prolog-mode crash in singleton handling.

    * Fixed some GUI-Tracer source-handling issues.

    * Fixed GUI-Tracer choice-point view.


XPCE
====

    * Added a new file-finder with more flexible (compatible) interface
      and a much better XPCE-provided file-dialog for the X11 version.

    * X11: fixed timers (sometimes stopped working).

    * Fixed window-placement (Windows)

    * Added `menu->insert_before' for easy insertion in existing
      menus

    * Added `dialog<->border' (default is <-gap)

    * Big performance improvement loading JPEG in the X11 version.

    * Many small improvements and additiona.  Check ChangeLog.
