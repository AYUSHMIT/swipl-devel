SWI-Prolog 5.2.4/XPCE 6.2.4 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.3
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Fix to call_cleanup/3 if the handler needs to be autoloaded and is
    called due to an exception.

  * Memory leaks in some multi-threaded application cooperation models.

Packages
--------

  * XML parser: fixes for handling character entities > 255 and UTF-8
    sequences > 255.


Development environment
-----------------------

  * Fix to the profiler (leading to very large overhead and memory usage).

  * Allow for extending the profiler with data from foreign libraries that
    have a notion of `executable code'.  Used with XPCE to incorporate
    individual methods into the profiler.

  * Fix to source-level debugger avoiding unnecessary use of decompiled
    code as well as printing improper lists in the variable-details window.


INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

  (none)
