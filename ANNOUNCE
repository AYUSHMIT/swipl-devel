SWI-Prolog 5.5.12/XPCE 6.5.12 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.
	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Getting close
			- Lacking input methods (XIM, ...)
			- Lacking support in Class regex

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.12 relative to 5.5.11
====================================

  * Fix floats on 64-bit platforms (GC error)

  * Various minor issues


Packages
========

  * XPCE: Added library(pce_progress), providing progress bars.
    Fixed locale issue making XPCE fail in environmens with different
    NUMERIC locale.  minor stuff.
  * SGML: Allow throwing exceptions from call-backs.  Minor stuff.
  * RDF: Fix for rdf:datatype handling.  Memory leak in process_rdf/2.
  * SemWeb: For rdf(?,+,?) where the predicate is not a yet known predicate.
    Used by rdf_bnode/1. Bug resulted in serious loss of memory and
    performance in applications using rdf_bnode/1 frequently.


Incompatible changes
====================

  * XPCE class file expands $VAR, etc as the file object is created instead
    of when it is accessed.  Should not affect many users.
