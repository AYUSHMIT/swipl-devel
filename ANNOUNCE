SWI-Prolog 5.5.6/XPCE 6.5.6 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * Wide character support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode

	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

      Lacking
      -------

	- No support for input methods (XIM, ...)
	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
		- Filenames, window titles, etc. in XPCE
	- Clear vision on foreign interface
	- Clear vision on handling non-iso-latin-1 8-bit codepages

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.6 relative to 5.5.5
==================================

  * Binary files be default use the new encoding 'octet'.

  * Additions to library ordsets for better compatibility.

  * Various minor patches


Packages
========

  * CLP(R): module issues, extended library ordsets to fully support it.

  * XPCE: Fixed various issues in handling objects as streams, making

    handling in sgml/xml modes.  Fixed PceEmacs issues to allow putting
    it into a saved state.  Improved xpce-stub.exe debugging.
