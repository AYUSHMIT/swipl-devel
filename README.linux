			SWI-Prolog on LINUX

This  file  used  to  hold an  enthousiastic  mail from   Phil Perucci
(dsc3pzp@nmrdc1.nmrdc.nnmc.navy.mil) describing  his linux    port  of
version 1.6.9.  The current version  is fully integrated and  requires
no additional README ... except for the GNU readline library.

This library  isn't  out for long  and the  official   GNU version 1.1
compiles fine on Linux but runs lousy :-(.  There  is a decent version
of this library in /pub/linux/lib/librl-1.1.tar.Z.
