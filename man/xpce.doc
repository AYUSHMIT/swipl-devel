The \url[XPCE GUI system]{http://www,swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/} for
dynamically typed languages has been with SWI-Prolog for a long time. It
is developed by Anjo Anjewierden and Jan Wielemaker from the department
of SWI, University of Amsterdam. It aims at a high-productive
development environment for graphical applications based on Prolog.

Object oriented technology has proven to be a suitable model for
implementing GUIs, which typically deal with things Prolog is not
very good at: event-driven control and global state. With XPCE, we
designed a system that has similar characteristics that make Prolog
such a powerful tool: dynamic typing, meta-programming and dynamic
modification of the running system.

XPCE is an object-system written in the C-language.  It provides for
the implementation of methods in multiple languages. New XPCE classes
may be defined from Prolog using a simple, natural syntax.  The body of
the method is executed by Prolog itself, providing a natural interface
between the two systems.  Below is a very simple class definition.

\begin{code}
:- pce_begin_class(prolog_lister, frame,
		   "List Prolog predicates").

initialise(Self) :->
        "As the C++ constructor"::
        send(Self, send_super, initialise, 'Prolog Lister'),
        send(Self, append, new(D, dialog)),
        send(D, append,
	     text_item(predicate, message(Self, list, @arg1))),
        send(new(view), below, D).

list(Self, From:name) :->
        "List predicates from specification"::
        (   catch(term_to_atom(Term, From), _, fail)
        ->  get(Self, member, view, V),
            pce_open(V, write, Fd),
            set_output(Fd),
            listing(Term),
            close(Fd)
        ;   send(Self, report, error, 'Syntax error')
        ).

:- pce_end_class.

test :- send(new(prolog_lister), open).
\end{code}

Its 165 built-in classes deal with the meta-environment,
data-representation and---of course---graphics. The graphics classes
concentrate on direct-manipulation of diagrammatic representations.

\paragraph{Availability.} XPCE runs on most Unix\tm{} platforms,
Windows~95, 98 and Windows~NT. It has been connected to SWI-Prolog,
SICStus\tm{} and Quintus\tm{} Prolog as well as some Lisp
dialects and C++. The Quintus version is commercially distributed and
supported as ProWindows-3\tm{}.

Windows~95, 98, NT and i386/Linux available from the
