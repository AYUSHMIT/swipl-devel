SWI-Prolog 5.2.3/XPCE 6.2.3 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.2
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Portability issues: cygwin, enhanced installation procedure to accomodate
    RPM and Debian package managers easier.  Ported thread-support to FreeBSD.

  * Fixed deadlock in thread_statistics/3.

  * Debugger issues: hide predicates starting with $ (Logtalk), make trace/0
    trap debugger on `skip', make behaviour of call_cleanup/3 consistent in
    debug/nondebug mode.


Packages
--------

  * Semweb: Added rdf_generation/1 which increments on any change to the
    database.

  * XPCE GUI system: Improved handling of type := initial in variable
    declarations, added menu_item->background, fixed redraw problems in
    MS-Windows (notably associated with the tabbed_window class), lowered
    priority of :: operator to improve coorperation with other packages.

  * library(pce_toc): use a small window to make partly obscured nodes
    visible.

Development environment
-----------------------

  * Many improvements to the SWI-Prolog manual browser.

  * Fix to source-level debugger avoiding unnecessary
    use of decompiled code.

  * Various improvements to the PceEmacs bookmark system.
