This module defines the  mode-selection  menu at  the left-side of the
canvas.  It consists of two classes: draw_menu, which is a subclass of
picture  and which  is responsible for  communication, load/save, etc.
and draw_icon, which defines the combination of a mode, a cursor and a
prototype.

There are two reasonable primitives  for implementing this menu.   The
first   is to use a  dialog  window and  a choice  menu, of which  the
menu_items have image labels.  The  second  is  the approach taken  in
this file, to use a picture with a 1-column  format attached to it and
images for the options.  Which of them is to be preferred is difficult
to   tell.    Both  approaches   require   about  the  same  amount of
programming.   I've  chosen  for  the  latter   approach,  partly  for
`historical'  reasons and partly to  illustrate how non-standard menus
can be created using ordinary graphicals.

As the  user can modify  the   menu by adding/deleting prototypes  and
changing prototype attributes, the contents of  this menu can be saved
to file.

Create  the picture.   The width  of the  picture   is fixed using the
->hor_stretch and  ->hor_shrink methods.   Next, a  `format' object is
attached to the picture.  When a  format is attached  to a device, the
graphicals are  located   according  to  the   format   specification.
Attaching a  format object to a  device is a   simple way to represent
tabular information in PCE.

NOTE:	Formats are a rather hacky solution.  There are plans to
	extend them with a more powerful table mechanisms.

We have chosen  to specialise class   `bitmap' to represent the  icon.
Each icon represents a prototype, a mode and a cursor that is  used by
the canvas to indicate the mode.  The visual representation of an icon
is  an outline that indicates  the mode  and  a  small  version of the
prototype to indicate what is drawn.

There are two   reasonable choices  for this job.   One is   to use  a
subclass of device and display the outline  and a resized clone of the
prototype.  The other is to use class bitmap and  draw  a clone of the
prototype in it.  It is difficult to say which of the two is better. I
finally decided that just a bitmap is cheaper to save (considering the
fact  that  the device  case holds a  bitmap  of the  same  size too).
Another criterium is how difficult it is to  change an argument of the
prototype.  For a device this is slightly simpler  as we just pass the
message to change the argument to the prototype  and the clone  of the
prototype displayed in the icon.  Using a bitmap, we have to recompute
the contents of the bitmap.  This however is not very hard.
