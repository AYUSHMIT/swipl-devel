INTRODUCTION

This version of the INSTALL description  is completely rewritten for the
new source organisation that comes  with   XPCE  4.8.0  and later.  This
documentation describes installation from the  SOURCES.  For BINARY ONLY
installation, see the file BININSTALL.

The installation procedure for  a  large  part   relies  on  the  use of
GNU-Project tools.  It is tested to work with the following tools:

	make:		GNU-Make 3.62 and 3.70
	C-compiler:	gcc/g++ 2.5.[78]


GENERAL PROCEDURE

1) Make sure to have the proper  tools and the hosting language (Prolog,
Lisp, etc.) installed properly.

2) Edit the main Makefile.  All variables   may be set in this Makefile.
The variables are exported to  the   various  sub-makes  fired from this
directory.

3) Type `make' to build the XPCE  library   and  link it to the selected
host language.

4)  Test  the  executable  (which  is   normally  stored  in  the  `bin'
subdirectory).

5) [SWI-Prolog version only!!!] If all functions well, type ./install to
install the libraries and binaries in   the selected directories.  After
installation you may discard this distribution directory.
