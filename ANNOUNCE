SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Minor patches.

Packages
========

  * Updated the ODBC (database) interface.  It is still immature,
    but it is not unlikely to help get your database connected
    easily and reliably.  Notably thanks to Mike Elston to test
    and comment on the many intermediate versions.

Environment
===========

  * Windows users will most probably be happy with many more
    Windows-compatible accelerators in the tools: ^C, ^X, ^V
    for standard copy/cut/paste, ^O, ^N (open, new) and ^P
    print.

    Both Emacs and CUA (Common User Access) mode are supported
    on all platforms.  On Windows CUA is the default.
    CUA cut/copy conflict with Emacs prefix keys has been resolved
    using the same technique as the GNU-Emacs cua.el package. 

    The different styles are realised by xpce/prolog/boot/pce_keybinding.pl,
    which can be modified and extended in Prolog.

  * Printing of buffer and region.  In the Windows version the
    printed version includes the syntax-based colouring provided
    by PceEmacs Prolog mode.


XPCE
====

  * Various improvements to handle image transperency and write
    transparent images, notably on Windows.

  * Many modification to the editor and keyboard accelerator
    framework to improve compatibility.

  * Minor patches.
