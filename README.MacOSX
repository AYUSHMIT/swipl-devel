SWI-Prolog on MacOS X (Darwin)

Thanks  to  Jacobo  Myerston   <jacunix@cantv.net>    and   Paulo  Moura
<pmoura@noe.ubi.pt> for their help on   assembling  this version. Jacobo
produces binary packages on a regular basis. Please visit the SWI-Prolog
home and download on www.swi-prolog.org.

As of SWI-Prolog 5.0.2, the  SWI-Prolog   sources  have  been adapted to
compile and run flawlessly on MacOS X,   including all packages and XPCE
using X11.

The plld compile/link utility is  capable   of  producing shared objects
from foreign code to  be  loaded  in   SWI-Prolog  as  well  as embedded
executables.


Installing from the source
==========================

There are no longer special instructions  for installing SWI-Prolog from
the sources. Of course you do need  the development environment and some
compatibility libraries (dlcompat, readline). To   build  XPCE, you also
need the X11 development environment  and   the  XPM and JPEG libraries.
Please visit the Twiki web on SWI-Prolog for details:

Installing the binary
=====================

In order to install SWI-Prolog you must   have XFree86 installed in your
computer. A double-clickable installer for XFree86 4.2.0  on Mac OS X is
available from the XonX project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx. A
binary distribution is  also  available  from   the  XFree86  web  page:
http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0

Once  you  have  installed  XFree86  you   just  have  to  double  click
SWI-Prolog.mpkg.  The  installer  will  ask  you  for  an  administrator
password, and you will have to agree the terms of the license.


Running SWI-Prolog
------------------

The executable of SWI-Prolog is installed as /usr/local/bin/swipl. Using
normal setup, it can be started by typing the command

	swipl

in a terminal window. This may  fail   if  /usr/local/bin is not in your
`PATH'. In that case you can start   SWI-Prolog  by typing the full path
name or you have to modify PATH first.

The    libraries    and    other    resources     are    installed    in
/usr/local/lib/pl-<version>/
