# This is the script we use to   build  SWI-Prolog and all its packages.
# Copy the script to  `build',  edit   to  suit  the  local installation
# requirements and run it. Once correct, upgrading   to a new release is
# now limited to getting the new sources and run ./build.

# [EDIT] Prefix location of the installation. It is _not_ advices to use
# a    versioned    prefix.    The    system      will     install    in
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version> and create symlinks from  $PREFIX/bin for the
# main  programs.  Users  can  always  use  older  versions  by  running
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version>/bin/<arch>/pl
