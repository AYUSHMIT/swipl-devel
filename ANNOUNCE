SWI-Prolog 5.1.6/XPCE 6.1.6 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 7th beta-release.  Considering feedback, the 5.1.x series probably becomes
    mainstream not too far from here.

    Remaining issues are exploiting the multi-threaded version in a
    multi-threaded foreign environment, which is currently incompatible
    to using the single threaded version.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Minor issues.

Packages
========

  * RDF: Now fully compliant with the current RDF specs, including
    rdf:nodeID.  It passes the W3C test-suite without errors (well,
    at the moment the suite it passes is inofficial as this work
    exposed a bug in the testcases :-).

  * HTTP: Added proxy support to the to HTTP client packages and
    redirection support to http_open/3.

  * XPCE: Added support for reading .ICO files from streams (Windows),
    so they can be added to programs as Prolog resources.  Added generation
    of colour PostScript from images, frames and the display.  Various
    small bugs fixed.

Development environment
=======================

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Provide support for N Prolog engines in M threads (N>=1, M>=1).

  * Resolve Java interface issues (Linking issues and related to the above)

Donations
=========

Donations, small and big, are well appreciated, as are critisism and plans
to turn SWI-Prolog in a self-supporting project.  Please visit
