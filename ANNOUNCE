SWI-Prolog 5.5.11/XPCE 6.5.11 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * Wide character support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

      Lacking
      -------

	- No support for input methods (XIM, ...)
	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
		- window titles, etc. in XPCE

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.11 relative to 5.5.10
====================================

  * Rewrote most of the `xos' layer providing better POSIX functionality
    for Windows to provide UTF-8 access to Windows UNICODE filenames.

  * Added setlocale/3


Packages
========

  * XPCE: rewrote most of the file access to access filesnames according
    to the locale and to the new XOS layer for MS-Windows, accessing
    files using UNICODE names.


Incompatible changes
====================

  * XPCE class file expands $VAR, etc as the file object is created instead
    of when it is accessed.  Should not affect many users.
