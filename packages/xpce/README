This directory contains XPCE, an   object-oriented  symbolic programming
environment for User Interfaces.  XPCE has   been  designed to cooperate
with symbolic languages such as Lisp and Prolog.


Authors

The development of XPCE was started   by  Anjo Anjewierden.  The package
was then called PCE.  He  designed  and   implemented  version  1 and 2.
Version 3 is the result of a joint  effort from Anjo Anjewierden and Jan
Wielemaker.  This was the last version based  on SunView.  Version 4 has
been designed and implemented by  Jan   Wielemaker.   It  makes the full
object oriented mechanisms underlying PCE  available   to  the Prolog or
Lisp programmer and is based on X-windows rather than SunView.
