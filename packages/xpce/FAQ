Fooled you, this isn't the FAQ :-)

There are a couple of FAQ's for XPCE nowadays:

	* Luca Passani (passani@idt.unit.no) is maintaining a
	`Programmers FAQ', a summary of questions and answers handled on
	the xpce@swi.psy.uva.nl mailing or personally by the authors
	(xpce-request@swi.psy.uva.nl).

	You find this FAQ on WWW:

		http://www.stud.unit.no:80/~passani/FAQ.html

	* A FAQ discussing availability, conditions, and other administrative
	issues. This one is maintained by the authors
	(xpce-request@swi.psy.uva.nl):

		http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/xpcefaq.html

	Of course there is also info in the main HTML page of XPCE:

		http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/xpce.html

	* Finally, try File/FAQ from the XPCE online manual tools for
	those that have no access to the net.
