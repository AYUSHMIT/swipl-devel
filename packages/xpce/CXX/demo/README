This directory contains demos for the   XPCE/C++ interface.  These demos
have been developed to test  and   illustrate  the  functionality of the
interface; not to be pretty  looking   programs.   Please try the Prolog
demos to get an overview of the functionality of XPCE.

This  is  an  alpha   version   of    the   C++   interface.   See  also
$PCEHOME/README.C++.
