SWI-Prolog is a comprehensive and portable implementation of the Prolog
programming language. SWI-Prolog aims to be a robust and scalable
implementation supporting a wide range of applications. In particular,
it ships with a wide range of interface libraries, providing interfaces
to other languages, databases, graphics and networking. It provides
extensive support for managing HTML/SGML/XML and RDF documents.  The
system is particularly suited for server applications due to robust
support for multithreading and HTTP server libraries.

SWI-Prolog is designed in the `Edinburgh tradition'. In addition to the
ISO Prolog standard it is largely compatible to Quintus, SICStus and YAP
Prolog.  SWI-Prolog provides a compatibility framework developed in
cooperation with YAP and instantiated for YAP, SICStus and IF/Prolog.

SWI-Prolog aims at providing a good development environment, including
extensive editor support, graphical source-level debugger, autoloading
and `make' facility and much more. SWI-Prolog editor and the PDT plugin
for Eclipse provide alternative environments.

This document gives an overview of the features, system limits and
built-in predicates.
