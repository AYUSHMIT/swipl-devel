SWI-Prolog 5.1.3/XPCE 6.1.3 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 4th beta-release.  Suitable for research and development.
    Discouraged for production usage.  It has a few 5.0.10 bugs
    fixed but surely introduced new ones.


SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Provide message-queues as first class objects, so one queue can
    serve multiple threads for simple realisation of the `worker pool'
    design.

  * Avoid leaking mutexes and condition-variables when creating and
    destroying threads.

  * Added a set_stream(Stream, timeout(Seconds)) to cause input from
    the stream to generate an exception if no input arrives.

  * Various issues when managing threads from C.

  * Various minor bug-fixes


Packages
========

  * CLIB: Many bugfixes for the Windows implementation of the
    socket library.  I shouldn't forget to acknowlegde Peter Marks and
    Mike Elston for their determinism in creating yet another program
    illustrating a problem.  Thanks!

  * RDF: Make process_rdf work again.

  * XPCE: Forgotten mutex unlock, causing the GUI to freeze in some
    MT usage.  Various minor problems fixed.


Development environment
=======================

  * Added ?- prolog_ide(thread_monitor). as well as menu-options for
    this, showing status of running threads graphically.


Short-term Plans
================

  * More RDF/RDFS/OWL handling

  * More multi-threading support (thread-monitor, debugging, etc).

  * Some ODBC issues
 
  * Resolve Java interface issues
