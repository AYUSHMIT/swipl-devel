SWI-Prolog 5.1.1/XPCE 6.1.1 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 2nd beta-release.  Suitable for research and development.
    Discouraged for production usage.  


SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Both Linux and Windows binaries now come as multi-threaded versions.
    
  * Performance improvements in shallow backtracing (+/- 30%) and
    indexing (+/- 10%).

  * Moved list predicates (member/2, etc) from built-in to a new
    library(lists) for better compatibility and allow students to
    define these predicates without name-conflict.
    
    Existing code shouldn't be affected due to the auto-loader.

  * Fixed assertion-failure on negative reference-count in atoms.
    Notably affects embedded applications and platforms that do not
    zero memory before handing it new applications.

  * Updated Windows makefiles to deal properly with spaces in source
    and target folders and run on Windows 2000.  For better security,
    compilation is moved to a VMWARE virtual machine with only access
    to its hosting Linux machine and is only used for compiling Prolog.


Packages
========

  * ODBC: Bug-fixes handling long VARCHAR and VARBINARY data-types.

  * SGML/XML parser: Small fixes, notably in XML mode.

  * RDF-Parser: Updated for the new revised syntax (8 nov).  Most important
    additions are support for xml:base and parseType="Collection".  The
    source-tree includes code for handling the W3C RDF test-suite.  The
    library(rdf_diagram) is added to visualise triples as a graph
    (documentation follows later).
    
  * XPCE: Made windows version thread-safe.  Minor patches.


Development environment
=======================

  * Minor patches


Short-term Plans
================

  * More RDF/RDFS/OWL handling

  * More multi-threading support (thread-monitor, debugging, etc).

  * Some ODBC issues
 
  * Resolve Java interface issues
