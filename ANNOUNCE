SWI-Prolog 5.5.5/XPCE 6.5.5 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * Wide character support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode

	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

      Lacking
      -------

	- No support for input methods (XIM, ...)
	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
		- Filenames, window titles, etc. in XPCE
	- Clear vision on foreign interface
	- Clear vision on handling non-iso-latin-1 8-bit codepages

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.


Patches in 5.5.5 relative to 5.5.4
==================================

  * Port: provide support for "make install DESTDIR=..." and lots of
    cleanup for more flexible building on Unix systems.  This supports
    packagers, such as the MacOS 'port' utility.
    
  * Binary: Windows binary version is now compiled using MSVC 6.0.  This
    should not have any consequences, but you never know ...

Packages
========

  * XPCE: Fixed using text_buffer for (temporary) binary output (used
    to serve images using the XPCE HTTPD library).  Removed maximum
    number of item limit on dialog windows.

Incompatible changes
====================

  (none)
