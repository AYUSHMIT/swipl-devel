SWI-Prolog 5.0.2/XPCE 6.0.2 Summary of changes

SWI-Prolog
==========

	* Souces compile flawlessly on MacOS X (well, on a few systems
	  at least :-), including building shared objects and embedded
	  executables using plld.  All standard packages build fine.

	  Binaries using the Flink (debian) packages are expected
	  shortly.

	* Fixed various issues in multi-threading and signal handling

	* Added library(time) to the clib package to deal with scheduled
	  alarms on both Unix and Windows systems.

	* Better expansion of ~ on windows systems

	* Many fixes to the graphical tracer

	* Many additions to colour-mode of the built-in editor: more
	  categories, better handling of meta-calls, right-button menu
	  to many fragments (jump to source/documentation) and feedback
 	  in the status line.

XPCE
====

	* Fixes tab-ed dialogs (broken is last release)

	* Improvements in focus handling on Unix/X11 version

	* Port to MacOS X (using X11).
