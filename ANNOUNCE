SWI-Prolog 5.6.0/XPCE 6.6.0 stable release
==========================================

Highlights of changes since 5.4.x
=================================

Unicode support
---------------

The basic SWI-Prolog engine and many of   the important packages now the
UNICODE character set. This simplifies   applications handling documents
of several characters sets simultaneously,   something which is commonly
found in web-applications. Prolog can now  represent any HTML, SGML, XML
or  RDF  document   without   loss    of   information   or  complicated
representations.

Especially programs manipulating character sets   other than ISO-Latin-1
must be checked. The  predicates  get_code/2   and  get_byte/2  are  now
different! Character codes are indenpendent  of   the  locale,  but code
using explicit numeric character  codes  must   be  updated  to  use the
UNICODE values or -better- the 0'<char> syntax

Please check the section name "Wide character encodings on streams" in
the manual for further reference.


Unbounded integer and rational arithmetic
-----------------------------------------

By default SWI-Prolog is now linked   against the GNU Multiple Precision
arithmetic library (GMP), This provides unbounded arithetic as expressed
in the ISO Prolog flag `bounded' absence of the Prolog flags min_integer
and max_integer. With this  change  the   dubious  silent  conversion of
integer to float on arithmetic overflow   as  well conversion of `whole'
floats to integers has been removed.

Rational arithmetic allows for expressions such as

	?- A is 1 rdiv 4 + 5 rdiv 6.

	A = 13 rdiv 12


New and improved constraint libraries
-------------------------------------

5.6.0 has a much faster version  of   the  CHR constraint library by Tom
Schrijvers, clp(r) by Leslie  de  Koninck   as  well  as  some dedicated
constraint libraries by Markus Triska.


Semantic Web library
--------------------

There are many additions to the  semantic web infra-structure, including
full  thread-safety,  transaction  support  and   triggers  in  the  RDF
store.


Version 5.6.17 Patches relative to 5.6.16
=========================================

Prolog

  * MODIFIED: predicate_property(Pred, number_of_clauses(N)) returns 0
    for dynamic predicates with 0 clauses.
  * FIXED: Added Unicode support to DDE interface.
  * FIXED: Various long/int issues calling PL_unify_term().  Affects 64-bit
    systems only.
  * FIXED: Memory violation getting thread-CPU time in Linux.  With help
    of Jacco van Ossenbruggen.
  * ADDED: Allow reading comments in read_term/3.  Ongoing work.
  * FIXED: Graphical debugger after throw/1.  Alan Baljeu.
  * FIXED: fatal error on read/1 in 0-bytes outside quoted strings/atoms.
  * FIXED: Error tracing multi-threaded code in plcon.exe.  Mike Elston.
  * ADDED: Prolog flag verbose_load to get status of silent(Bool) from
    load_files/2.  Tom Schrijvers.
  * ADDED: First version of new time support.  With input from various
    users from the mainlinglist.
  * ENHANCED: Try to reuse variable names when writing results of toplevel
    queries.
  * ADDED: with_output_to(+Out, :Goal) to allow writing to atoms, strings,
    code-lists, etc.  Also allows for format(+Out, +Fmt, +Args) with the
    same specifications.  Moved sformat/[2,3] to the compatibility library.
  * MODIFIED: functions lsb and msb throw domain error on 0.  Updated
    documentation.  With help from Richard O'Keefe and Bart Demoen.
  * ADDED: Documentation for library(ordsets).

							    
Packages
  
  * SGML: fix to space(default) handling
  * ODBC: Fixed odbc_current_connection(-,-).  
  * XPCE: Fixed: Colours of arrow-heads in PostScript generation
  * Semweb: rdf_save/2 to use rdf:nodeID for bnodes used multiple times.
