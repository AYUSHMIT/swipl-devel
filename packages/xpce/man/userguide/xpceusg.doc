\begin{abstract}
XPCE/Prolog is a hybrid environment integrating logic programming and
object-oriented programming for Graphical User Interfaces.  Applications
in XPCE/Prolog are fully compatible across the supported X11 and
Win32 (Windows 95 and Windows NT) platforms.

XPCE has been connected to the following Prolog systems.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \url[SWI-Prolog]{http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/usr/jan/SWI-Prolog.html}
    \item \url[Quintus Prolog]{http://www.aiil.co.uk/prolog/frames_home.htm}
    \item \url[SICStus Prolog]{http://www.sics.se/isl/sicstus.html}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Note.} Although this document is created december 1996, it is
not in sync with the current system (XPCE 4.9.0).  Everything documented
here is still valid, but some new features should shortly find a place
in this document.  They include new facilities for handling colour,
using XPCE objects as a Prolog {\em stream} and more advanced
organisation of applications using class \class{application}.

\subsubsection*{About this document}

This document is maintained in the LaTeX document processing system. It
was converted to HTML format using a latex2html written in SWI-Prolog
which, unlike
\url[latex2html]{http://www-dsed.llnl.gov/files/programs/unix/latex2html/sources/},
concentrates on extensibility, rather then making the HTML document
look as closely as possible the same as the LaTeX version.  The document
is maintained using macros dedicated to describe its content.  These
macros are defined both for LaTeX to arrive at a proper typeset version,
and for the latex2html translator to arrive at a proper hypertext
document. For further information, please contact \email[Jan
Wielemaker]{jan@swi.psy.uva.nl}

Each section in the document is translated into an HTML page.  Each
page contains links to the \strong{table of contents}, \strong{Index},
and \strong{Class Summary}.  Subsections contain links to their
super-section, and sections that have subsections contain a
\strong{`local' index} at the end of the page.
