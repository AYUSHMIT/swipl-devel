Fooled you, this isn't the FAQ :-)

You find FAQ-like information at the following places

	* A FAQ discussing availability, conditions, and other administrative
	issues. This one is maintained by the authors
	(xpce-request@swi.psy.uva.nl):

		http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/xpcefaq.html

	Of course there is also info in the main HTML page of XPCE:

		http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/xpce.html

	* Finally, try File/FAQ from the XPCE online manual tools for
	those that have no access to the net.
