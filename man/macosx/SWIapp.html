<h4>The SWI-Prolog MacOSX app</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> is an open source
implementation of the Prolog programming language. SWI-Prolog targets at
developing real-world applications. To achieve this, in concentrates on
libraries that facilitate interfacing to other software components,
networking and multi-threading. SWI-Prolog can be used from
<code>Terminal</code>, as an standard Mac application started from
<code>Finder</code>, under <a
href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/GnuEmacs.html">GNU-Emacs</a> or
under the <a href="http://sewiki.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/pdt/">Eclipse
IDE</a>. </p>

<p>
The SWI-Prolog development tools, such as the source-level debugger, are
based on xpce, SWI-Prolog's native graphics toolkit. This toolkit
<b>requires X11</b>.  X11 is a default component of Mac OS X v10.5 to v10.7.
As of v10.8 (<b>Mountain Lion</b>), X11 must be installed seperately and can
be downloaded from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org</a>
</p>

<p>
The SWI-Prolog app can be executed directly from the disk image, can be
installed in <code>/Applications</code> or in any other location, i.e.,
it is <i>relocatable</i>. The app advertises itself to the launcher as
<em>shell</em> for files with extensions <code>.pl</code> and
<code>.prolog</code>
</p>

<p>
The traditional command line tools are included in the app. To access
them from <code>Terminal</code>, add the directory
<code>/Applications/SWI-Prolog/Contents/MacOS</code> to
<code>$PATH</code> (replace with the actual location if you installed
the app in a different location).
