Linux Software Map Entry Template                            Release: 05SEP93
=============================================================================

Synopsis:

The LSM is a directory of information about each of the software packages
available via FTP for the Linux operating system.  It is meant to be a public
information resource.  All entries have been entered by volunteers all over
the world via email using the template below.  New versions will appear
first on sunsite.unc.edu and will be announced in the newsgroup
comp.os.linux.announce .  Discussions pertaining to the LSM will be held in
the newsgroup comp.os.linux.help .  Any questions or comments can be entered in
comp.os.linux.help or sent to me directly at jeffk@msen.com .

Instructions:

Any new packages or updates to old entries should be entered in the template
below and sent to jeffk@msen.com (Jeff Kopmanis).  Each release of the
LSM will have the current template as part of the package.  Any changes to
the template will be made and released there.

*PLEASE* use the entry template below when submitting information.  It has
been designed so that all you have to do is fill in the blanks and send it
in as is.  Your entry will be read into the database directly from your
email response with little if any hand manipulation.

DO NOT RENAME FIELDS.  DO NOT REMOVE THE BEGIN OR END MARKERS.  Please pay
attention to the field lengths listed to the left of the field names, as 
any text beyond that length will be truncated.  If you use some of the new
fields, be sure to use the newer Begin2 keyword to start your entry to
save me a few headaches and file editing.

Complete as many fields as possible.  As of the 05SEP93 version, you don't
need to keep blank fields around, but I strongly encourage developers to
complete all the fields, as its more descriptive.  Make any corrections
that are necessary.  The initial data came from a variety of sources, 
and is not at all assumed to be correct.

Once you have completed the documentation as best as possible, email the
modified version of this file to:   jeffk@msen.com

Thank you VERY much for your time and enthusiasm.  Your contribution will
help to ensure that the Linux Software Map will continue to be a trusted
Linux resource.

-Jeff.  :)   (jeffk@msen.com) (Jeffrey J. Kopmanis)


============================================================================
Changes in 05SEP93:

No field lengths are needed in the actual template entry.  I've got the lengths
in the field description section of this document.

You can leave fields out.  If they're blank, leave 'em out.

Expanded fields: 5 lines of descriptions, 4 lines of required, 2 lines of
copypolicy, 4 comment lines, 3 lines of relatedfiles, 4 site/path/file/size
groups.

Site, Path, File and Size are now separate fields.  Also, there are 4 possible
site/path/file/size groups allowed.  This should cover just about anything.

Author and email have been split up.

Entered and Enteredby have been split up.

PkgName and Last3Rel are gone.

Things that were 65 chars are now 80.  In general, areas that didn't have
enough space were expanded to hold what was coming in.
