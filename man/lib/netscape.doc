\libdoc{netscape}{Activating your Web-browser}

This library deals with the very system dependent task of opening a
web-browser.  See also \pllib{url}.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{www_open_url}{1}{+URL}
Open \arg{URL} in an external web-browser. The reason to place this in
the library is to centralise the maintenance on this highly platform
and browser specific task.  It distinguishes between the following
cases:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [MS-Windows]
If it detects MS-Windows it uses win_shell/2 to open the \arg{URL}.  The
behaviour and browser started depends on the Window and Windows-shell
configuration, but in general it should be the behaviour expected by
the user.

    \item [Other platforms]
On other platforms it assumes the browser is \program{netscape}.  It
first tries to tell a running netscape to open the page and only after
this fails it starts a new browser.
\end{itemlist}
