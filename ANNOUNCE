SWI-Prolog 5.0.10/XPCE 6.0.10 Summary of changes

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Mostly portability patches, notably for gcc-3.x, Solaris 9 and
    MacOS X 10.2.  Some code and configuration cleanup.  In general,
    be careful with gcc 3.x as there appear to be some buggy versions
    around.

  * Fixed some issues around the *-> operator.

Packages
========

  * ODBC: More bug-fixes.  There are probably still problems with certain
    odbc drivers and database drivers, but I consider the library API
    stable and the library ready for real use.  Main test platforms
    are Linux/UnixODBC/MySQL and Windows NT/MS-ODBC/SQL Server.

  * SGML/XML parser:
    **MODIFIED** XML+Namespaces (mode xmlns): unqualified attributes are no
    longer qualified to the namespace of their element.  Though the standard
    says they are normally interpreted in the namespace of the element it
    also says they are unqualified.

    There is a new option qualify_attributes(Bool) to get the old behaviour
    as this is sometimes handy and makes it easier to deal with code assuming
    the old behaviour.

    The RDF parser is adjusted to deal with these changes.

    **MODIFIED**: when entities are redefined, the first value is used
    (i.e. the attempt to redefine is ignored) rather than the last encountered
    definition.  Again to comply to the standards.

    *FIXES*: There are some fixes to the SGML parser, notably handling
    <em/shorttag/ elements and parsing DTD from the <!DOCTYPE xx [...]>
    in-document definition.  In addition, there is a fix in XML mode
    handling documents that have <!ATTLIST declarations, but no <!ELEMENT
    declarations.

  * XPCE: Improvements for handling out-of-memory conditions, especially
    for strings.  Increased maximum string length from 16MB to 128 MB.
    Fixed a rare but very dangerous memory management problem.

Environment
===========

  * Some minor patches to the source-level debugger.
