SWI-Prolog 5.5.18/XPCE 6.5.18 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.
	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Limited XIM support for X11 version
			- No input method support in Windows version

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.19 relative to 5.5.18
====================================

  (none)

Packages
========

  * XPCE: X11 version: change KeyPress handling to use XIM.  Too simple
    implementation, but it fixes key composition requires for many 
    latin languages.
    
  * SemWeb: Loading files did not cause re-hashing, which eventually
    slowed down duplicate handling.  Fixed.  Reduces loading a 8 million
    triples file from 1,900 seconds to 55 seconds.  Also tuned parameters
    to reduce memory requirements and some new statistics.

  * CLIB: Added sources of mime support libraries to package.  Sorted out
    license issues around these libraries.
