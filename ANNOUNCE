SWI-Prolog 5.1.9/XPCE 6.1.9 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 10th beta-release.  Considering feedback, the 5.1.x series probably becomes
    mainstream not too far from here.

    Remaining issues are exploiting the multi-threaded version in a
    multi-threaded foreign environment, which is currently incompatible
    to using the single threaded version.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * FIXED: Fixed a couple of threading errors.  Most serious one is a race
    condition is messages queues waited for by multiple threads.

  * MODIFIED: succ/2 now only handles natural numbers (>= 0)

  * MODIFIED: make/0 has been moved to the library.  After completion,
    make/0 performs a quick checks for undefined predicates.  Let me know
    whether you like this.

Packages
========

  * XPCE: Some cleanup to the `document rendering' library.  Enchanced
    the `xml_browser' and added to the demo programs.  Show windows in
    tables.  Some fixes to the Prolog library.
    
  * ODBC: Added odbc_fetch/3, providing forward-chaining and random
    access to the result-set.

  * RDF: Allow prefixing anonymous resources (with the base-URL).

Development environment
=======================

  * Avoid re-colouring errors while showing a popup.

  * Comment XPCE comments.

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Provide support for N Prolog engines in M threads (N>=1, M>=1).

  * Resolve Java interface issues (Linking issues and related to the above).

Donations
=========

Donations, small and big, are well appreciated, as are critisism and plans
to turn SWI-Prolog in a self-supporting project.  Please visit
