			     XPCE HTTP LIBRARY

This library provides some useful starting point to make XPCE/SWI-Prolog
act as a web-server. This package is  futher documented in the XPCE User
Guide.

This package is designed with the following goals in mind:

	* Document export
	Applications that need to export documents may choose to do so
 	in HTML format.  This allows you to use your browser to preview,
	print and export the document to other applications.

	* Sharing documents over the web
	You can have other people looking at data from your running
	application!

	* Web-server application prototyping.

Files:
------

	# httpd.pl
	Generic HTTPD class.  To be subclassed to achieve a real server

	# html_write.pl
	Emit HTML pages from a structured description based on
	grammarrules

	# html_hierarchy.pl
	Display a hierarchy as an explorer-like tree in HTML.

	# http_man.pl
	Small demo exporting XPCE classes.


Status:
-------

This library is a demonstrator. The   bahaviour  of html_write and httpd
are incomplete and will be expanded.   Minor incompatibilities should be
expected, but not a large redesign.
