Dear Linux user,

I'm happy to announce XPE/SWI-Prolog  versions 4.8.0/1.9.0 for PC/Linux.
XPCE is a  symbolic  object-oriented   interface  toolkit  for  symbolic
programming languages (Oops, if this doesn't sell  it I give up!).  XPCE
offers a high level of  abstraction   for  communication  with X11, Unix
processes, Unix networking facilities (sockets)  and Unix files.  XPCE's
built-in classes (about 150) are mostly written  in the C language.  The
XPCE/Prolog interface allows the  user  to   create  instances  of these
classes and manipulate instances.  The  user   can  also create new XPCE
classes from Prolog.

XPCE's  window  related  classes  provide   various  styles  of  menu's,
primitive  graphical  objects,  compound  graphical  objects  and  Emacs
oriented programmable text manipulation windows.

Version  4.8.0  provides  good  colour  support,  requires  less  memory
(notably when dealing with text), is   much  faster in text-handling and
some graphical changes due to improved   redraw-planning  system and has
many bugs fixed.

The distribution entails various demo programs, including

	* PceDraw: a (diagram) drawing tool
	* Ispell: graphical interface for Unix ispell
	* Kangaroo: Jumping kangaroos (animation demo)
	* PceEmacs: Epoch like editor with modes for prolog, c, latex,
	  Unix-manual, gdb, etc.
	* PceManual: Online hyper-text like manual for XPCE itself
	* Dialog: a Graphical Dialog Box Editor.

TESTED LIB/OS VERSIONS:

	* Linix-1.0.9
	* XFree 2.1
	* Compiled by GCC 2.5.8
	* ldd pl/src/xpce.base
        libXt.so.3 (DLL Jump 3.1) => /usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.3.1.0
        libX11.so.3 (DLL Jump 3.1) => /usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.3.1.0
        libm.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.5pl24) => /lib/libm.so.4.5.24
        libc.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.5pl24) => /lib/libc.so.4.5.24
        librl.so.2 (DLL Jump 2.0pl3) => /lib/librl.so.2.0.3

The  binaries  for  /lib/librl.so.2.0.3  are    available  in  the  same
directory.  This is librl from sunsite,   but recompiled with the option
to indicate matching brackets.

With the proper libraries installed,  XPCE   should  run  on most modern
Linux systems that have ld.so installed.

LINUX BINARY VERSION vs. REGULAR VERSION

This  distribution  contains   a  binary  image  of  XPCE  connected  to
SWI-Prolog compiled  for  PC/Linux.   The regular  distribution  of XPCE
includes the sources and compiles on  various Unix machines  (see INFO).
It contains interfaces to both SWI-Prolog  and SICStus Prolog as well as
Sun  Lucid  CommonLisp and LispWorks.   See the file  INFO for  ordering
information.

There is a commercially supported version   of  the system available for
Quintus Prolog.  Contact Simon Heywood   at  AIIL (UK): simon@aiil.co.uk
for further details.

The  binary Linux version  is (albeit  possible  porting problems) fully
equivalent to  the regular version.  It  may be copied  free of  charge.
XPCE/SWI-Prolog is distributed in the hope  that it will be useful,  but
WITHOUT   ANY   WARRANTY;  without   even   the  implied   warranty   of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Holders of the regular licence are allowed to modify XPCE and/or connect
it to  other  languages.  They are allowed  to distribute fully compiled
and  linked  executables  that  include XPCE for  the PC/Linux operating
system under the same conditions as this distribution.
