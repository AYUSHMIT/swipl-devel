<H2><A NAME="sec:8.2">8.2 Monitoring threads</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:thmonitor"></A>

<P>Normal multi-threaded applications should not need these the 
predicates from this section because almost any usage of these 
predicates is unsafe. For example checking the existence of a thread 
before signalling it is of no use as it may vanish between the two 
calls. Catching exceptions using <A NAME="idx:catch3:1175"></A><A HREF="exception.html#catch/3">catch/3</A> 
is the only safe way to deal with thread-existence errors.

<P>These predicates are provided for diagnosis and monitoring tasks. See 
also <A HREF="thutil.html">section 8.5</A>, describing more high-level 
primitives.

the mutex. The collision-count is not available on Windows as this would 
break portability to Windows-95/98/ME or significantly harm performance. 
Generally collision count is close to zero on single-CPU hardware.

<H3><A NAME="sec:8.2.1">8.2.1 Linux: linuxthreads vs. NPTL</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:nptl"></A>

<P>Linux has introduces POSIX threads (pthread) using an implementation 
called <EM>linuxthreads</EM>, where each thread was `almost' a process. 
This approach has various disadvantages, such as poor performance and 
non-compliance with several aspects of POSIX. However, there is one 
advantage. Where pthread does not provide a way to get statistics per 
thread, we could get this info from the process-oriented times() 
function. Since the 2.6.x kernels, Linux by default now uses the
<EM>NPTL</EM> implementation which is POSIX compliant. Unfortunately, 
getting per-thread CPU statistics involves reading /proc and is 
therefore too slow for some applications.

<P>SWI-Prolog is setup to run with the default thread model. 
Unfortunately there is no way to modify this at runtime, but there is a 
way to select the old thread model on modern machines at <EM>link time</EM>. 
This is achieved using the environment variable <CODE>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</CODE> 
which must be set to a pre-nptl kernel version for linking the main 
executable. The value <CODE>2.4.21</CODE> is appropriate. When building 
from source, this flag can be set during the build process. When using a 
binary distribution one could create a minimal C program and relink the 
system using the plld utility.
