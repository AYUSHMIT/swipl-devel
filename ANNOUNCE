SWI-Prolog 5.2.8/XPCE 6.2.8 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.7
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Bug in compilation of \+ inside ;.  Under complicated conditions it
    can lead to data corruption that can crash the garbage collector and
    source-level debugger.

  * Bugfix in thread_local dynamic predicates (multi-threaded applications)
    No real bug, but automatic indexing fails, leaving predicates unindexed.

  * Some more sanity checks in module declarations.  Avoids loading a
    module file from silently overruling a dynamically created module.

  * The usual small and/or obscure stuff.

Packages
--------

  * XPCE: Various extensions and fixes.  Notably involved are trees,
    event-focus handling, drag-and-drop (inside the application), tooltips
    (windows: avoid loosing focus of underlying window) and the new `unclip'
    windows used by library(pce_toc): also focus and other coorperation
    issues with event-handling.  Fixed RPM binary compatibility issues with
    Mandrake Linux (dispite, I advice to recompile if you want to be sure).

  * Semweb: various improvements.  rdf_db.c can now handle properties with
    multiple super-properties and duplicate handling on delete is fixed.
    Various patches to rdf_edit.pl (transaction and undo management).

  * SGML: fixed memory leak.

Development environment
-----------------------

  * Bugfix in exception handling that sometimes crashes the debugger.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

  * Some issues in XPCE class tree and event-handling.  Unlikely to affect
    applications.  For details see XPCE ChangeLog.
