Installing the binary version:
==============================

The simplest method is to  make  a   *symbolic  link*  from  your public
executable directory to the executable   in  bin/<arch>/pl. Donot *copy*
the executable, as it uses the  information   from  the link to find the
location of the libraries.

If you installed this directory as

	/usr/local/lib/pl-@PLVERSION@

do (as root, where <arch> is the name of the architecture):

	# cd /usr/local/bin
	# ln -s /usr/local/lib/pl-@PLVERSION@/bin/<arch>/pl .


Customising the binary version
==============================:

You can make small  customisations  by   making/editing  a  file  called
`pl.rc' in the SWI-Prolog home directory.  This file is consulted before
personal initialisation files (~/.plrc) and before  the execution of the
-g initialisation goal.
