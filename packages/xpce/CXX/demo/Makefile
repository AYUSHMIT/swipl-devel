# This Makefile is a skeleton for compiling C++ programs for XPCE and
# linking them.  It needs a little configuration:
#
#	PCEHOME must be edited to point to the XPCE home directory
#	PCEARCH must be the machine-directory for the architecture you use
#		You can obtain this value using get(@pce, machine, M).
#
# READ-THIS READ-THIS READ-THIS READ-THIS
#
# G++ 2.4.5 and 2.5.4 (and very likely all others < g++-to-appear) has
# a bug which is `fixed' by preprocessing your input using m4.  Hence
# the -B$(PCEHOME)/include/ flag for g++.  In this directory is a cpp
# csh(1) script that links m4 before g++'s cpp.
#
# This Makefile skeleton is tested for gnu-make and SunOs 4.1.3 /bin/make
#
# Optimization note: using -O takes hardly longer than no optimization and
# reduces the size of the executable a *lot*.  -O is therefore the
# preferred optimisation mode.
