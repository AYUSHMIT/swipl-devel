The package directory  contains  a   subdirectory  for  each  SWI-Prolog
package. Without packages, SWI-Prolog is called SWI-Prolog/lite.

Building
--------

To build these packages, first build  and install SWI-Prolog itself This
creates Makefile, copying some of the   configuration  settings from the
SWI-Prolog configuration options.

Now edit the PKG variable  in  Makefile   to  reflect  the  packages and
options preferred. Then run

	./configure
	./make
	./make install
