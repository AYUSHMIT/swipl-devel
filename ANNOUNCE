SWI-Prolog 5.1.7/XPCE 6.1.7 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 9th beta-release.  Considering feedback, the 5.1.x series probably becomes
    mainstream not too far from here.

    Remaining issues are exploiting the multi-threaded version in a
    multi-threaded foreign environment, which is currently incompatible
    to using the single threaded version.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * FIXED Various threading issues: atom-garbage collection bugs, clean exit,
    SPARC alignment problem (bus error), execution profiling in Windows.

  * FIXED: atom_number/1 parsing floats.

  * ADDED: Allow reading the Prolog state if it is attached to a DLL.  This
    allows for single-file DLL's that embed Prolog.  See -dll option to
    plld.

  * PORT: configure problem for MT version if gcc doesn't understand -pthread.

Packages
========

  * XPCE: a few minor issues

Development environment
=======================

  * Make PceEmacs cross-referencer pick up :- meta_predicate/1 declarations.

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Provide support for N Prolog engines in M threads (N>=1, M>=1).

  * Resolve Java interface issues (Linking issues and related to the above).

Donations
=========

Donations, small and big, are well appreciated, as are critisism and plans
to turn SWI-Prolog in a self-supporting project.  Please visit
