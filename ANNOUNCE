SWI-Prolog 5.0.7/XPCE 6.0.7 Summary of changes

SWI-Prolog
==========
  
  * Windows: Added statistical profiling.  Fully operational on NT/2000/XP
    (tested on NT/TSE), cripple on 95/98/ME.

  * Windows: Editor handling problem

  * Windows: Borland C compatibility in headers.  See the Twiki web `Foreign'
    for using SWI-Prolog with Borland C.

  * MT-Version: atom-locking problem.

  * Data corruption crashing GC and GUI-tracer due to bad compilation of
    rather weird code involving \+ (bug was around for many years).

  * Slightly improved Edinburgh compatibility of telling/1 and seeing/1

  * SICStus 3.9 compatibility of absolute_file_name/3.

Development Environment
=======================

  * GUI-tracer: handling dynamic code holding floats, skip `hidden' frames
    when going `up'.

Packages
========

  * Updated installation of (not-default) packages "mp" and "db".  Added
    Windows Makefile for the "db" package (BerkeleyDB interface).

  * SGML2PL fix of marked-sections and handling of content_length option
    for partial parsing.

XPCE
====

   * X11: compatibility of X11 selection handling with (notably) Qt
   
   * Windows: much faster and better handling of JPEG images.

   * Various minor patches
