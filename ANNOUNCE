SWI-Prolog 5.5.13/XPCE 6.5.13 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.
	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Getting close
			- Lacking input methods (XIM, ...)

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.13 relative to 5.5.12
====================================

  * Added clp/clp_events.pl to installed system.

Packages
========

  * XPCE: Added library(pce_progress), providing progress bars.
    Fixed locale issue making XPCE fail in environmens with different
    NUMERIC locale.  minor stuff.


Incompatible changes
====================

  * XPCE class REGEX has a completely new implementation basis.  It used
    to run on the GNU-regex library using EMACS syntax.  The new version
    is based on the Tcl 8.5 regex library, a version of Henry Spencers
    regex adopted for UNICODE handling.  This regex library is also used
    by the Postgres project.  The library uses `modern-style' regex, which
    differ considerably from the old EMACS ones.

    There is a library(pce_regex_compat) explaining the issues and capable
    of doing transformation on Prolog source-files.
