X applications from different origin seem   to  obey different rules for
passing data around.  Some use  the   X-display  cut_buffers,  other the
X-display primrary selection  and  yet   other  the  X-display clipboard
selection.

This library is an atempt to  talk  to   everybody.   It  is used by the
manual tools as well as all the other XPCE/Prolog library modules.
