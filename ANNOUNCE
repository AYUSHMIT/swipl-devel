SWI-Prolog 5.5.28/XPCE 6.5.28 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.
	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Limited XIM support for X11 version
			- No input method support in Windows version

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.28 relative to 5.5.27
====================================

 * Added unbound integer and rational arithmetic support
 * MODIFIED: renamed assume/1 to assertion/1.  Suggested by Steve Moyle.
   The debug library issues a compatibility warning for assume/1.
 * MODIFIED: Dropped int_to_atom/3.  Considered non-standard and absolete.
   New code can use atom_number/2 for decimal numbers or sformat/3 for
   arbitrary conversions.
 * Unicode fix for win_shell/[2,3]
 * Bug in format using ~@

Packages
========
 
 * XPCE: handle unicode Prolog string objects, added `dropshadow' support
   for popup windows in XP, support `big' icons in Windows.
