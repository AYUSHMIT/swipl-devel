			    The XPCE UserGuide


This directory contains the sources to   the XPCE userguide. To generate
it you have to be a  bit  courageous.   By  default  it uses pdflatex to
generate a PDF document. For success you  have   to  make sure to have a
machine with recent copies of

	* epstopsf (>= 2.6)
	* pdflatex (>= 0.14f)

You should enlarge the pool_size of TeX   to 250000. This is a parameter
in texmf.cnf in modern teTeX based installations.

You also need to install xpce first as  this is used for generating part
of the PostScript diagrams on the fly.
