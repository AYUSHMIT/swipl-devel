SWI-Prolog 5.5.37/XPCE 6.5.37 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.
	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Limited XIM support for X11 version
			- No input method support in Windows version

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Added GMP support
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.37 relative to 5.5.36
====================================

 * New constraints my Markus Triska: clp_distinct.  New constraint added
   to bounds.pl: tuples_in/2.
 * New integer functions: lsb/1 and popcount/1
 * Memory leak related to GMP arithmetic, converting GMP number to float
   for intermediate result.
 * Fixed saved-state handling for huge clauses.
 * Some portability issues
 * Minor stuff

Packages
========
 
 * XPCE: Unicode patches.  Now allows for unicode class-names
 * SemWeb: Fix saving triple-sets using datatypes.
