Jun 22, 2007

* ADDED: View/threads menu item to get the thread-monitor.

VERSION 1.1.1 for SWI-Prolog 5.0.2
==================================

* FIXED: Handling of I_CATCH and I_CONTEXT instructions for unifying and
  locating calls in clauses.

* FIXED: Avoid sending ->file: @nil to the source-view

* FIXED: `Up' pass through foreign frames, so we can really get to the top,
  regardless of intermediate foreign frames caused by breaks, XPCE message
  passing, etc.
