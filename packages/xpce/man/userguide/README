			    The XPCE UserGuide


This directory contains the sources to   the XPCE userguide. To generate
it you have to be a bit courageous   and  you need a Unix machine. We've
(february 2001) used a machine running SuSE  linux 7.0. We rebuilt teTeX
from the most recent snapshot to get pdfTeX 0.14f.

By default it uses pdflatex to generate  a PDF document. For success you
have to make sure to have a machine with recent copies of

	* epstopsf (>= 2.6)
	* pdflatex (>= 0.14f)

You should enlarge the pool_size of TeX   to 250000. This is a parameter
in texmf.cnf in modern teTeX based installations.

You also need to install xpce first as  this is used for generating part
of the PostScript diagrams on the fly.
