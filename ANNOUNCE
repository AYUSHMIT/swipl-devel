SWI-Prolog 5.1.13/XPCE 6.1.13 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 14th beta-release.  Unless serious trouble shows up, the next release
    will be 5.2.0.  I.e. this will become the next stable release.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Fixed A =:= "x" in optimised mode and added handling 0'\n syntax.  Note
    thats this requires the backslash to be written as 0'\\.  This change
    is likely to affect compatibility.  Required by the ISO standard.
 
  * Important patch to compilation of \+/1, which could cause the garbage
    collector to reset variables only used in the scope of \+ and used in
    multiple goals (i.e. \+ (a(A), b(A))).

  * Windows: Replaced the Wise installer by the free software NSIS installer.
    Added Windows readme file.
    
  * Many patches for new GCC 3.3 compiler warnings.

Packages
========

  * SGML: New catalogue processing code (Richard O'Keefe).

Development environment
=======================

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Incorporate JPL (Java interface) in the main development tree.

Donations
