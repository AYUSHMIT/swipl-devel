Prepend the given directory  to  the   image  search-path.   Useful  for
applications defining a private image directory.

Typically one would put all images required   by  an application in *.bm
files in a directory called bitmaps.  The   load file of the application
makes a call

	:- pce_image_directory(bitmaps).

after which the images from the  directory   may  be accessed using -for
example-:

	send(Box, fill_pattern, image('my_image.bm')).

See also the ImageViewer demo  tool  to   get  an  overview of available
images in a directory.
