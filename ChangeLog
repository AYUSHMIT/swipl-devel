			SWI-Prolog ChangeLog
			====================

Version 2.5.4
=============

  * FIXED: read/1 for reading negative floating point numbers (2.5.x bug),
    thanks to Bill Jones.

  * FIXED: read/1, etc. for reading a single variable.  Found by Luu Tran.

  * FIXED: DCG expansion error found by Keith Whitwell.


Version 2.5.3
=============

  * ADDED: ISO at_end_of_stream/[0,1] and peek_byte/[1,2].

  * Fixed and faster nth0/3 and nth1/3 implementations by Martin Jansche.

  * New pl(1) manual page by Martin Jansche.  Thanks.

  * PORT: Ron Ferguson mailed me a couple of fixes for the NeXT machine,
    using release 2 of the C-compiler from the standard development system.
    Thanks.

  * FIXED: decompilation (listing, retract, etc.) for clauses using the
    new (2.5.x) A_REAL instruction.

  * FIXED: \=/2 and recorded/3 for handling shared variables.  Found
    by Joerg Garbers.

  * ADDED: edit definition for emacsclient(1).

  * Fixed unify (=/2) for unification of two floats.  Reported by Dave
    Moffat.

Version 2.5.2
=============

  * FIXED: PL_retry() and friends were lacking from the new SWI-Prolog.h

  * FIXED: PL_cons_functor() and PL_cons_list(), also fixing variable
    handling in bagof/setof.  Thanks to Khanh Doan for reporting.

  * ADDED: string_concat/3 with same semantics as concat/3, but unbound
    will be unified with a string object.

  * ADDED: rl_read_init_file(+File) and rl_add_history(+Line) for better
    readline interaction.  Added readline.3 to the standard installed
    manual set.

  * ADDED: file_name_extension/3 to reason about filename extensions in
    a machine-independent manner.  Fixes Win32 associations if the filename
    has uppercase extension.

Version 2.5.1 (released for Win32 only)
=======================================

  * FIXED: Stack expansion for some foreign predicates using the local
    stack as temporary area for machines with exception-based stack-overflow
    handling that do not provide the address of the segmentation fault to
    the handler (Win32, Linux).

  * FIXED: Linux: repeated handling of the sequence Control-C, abort.

  * FIXED: Crash after the system has ran out of some stacks on machines
    with exception-based stack-overflow handling and POSIX signals.
    Solaris, Linux and Win32 are the examples I know of.

  * FIXED: CVT_NUMBER and CVT_ATOMIC constants in SWI-Prolog.h,
    breaking name(+Float, -Chars).

  * FIXED: plus/3 for +, -, + instantiation (2.5.0 introduced typo).

  * FIXED: prototype declaraction reported by Martin Jansche.

Version 2.5.0
=============

  * Added features `trace_gc' and `gc'.

  * Added `pl -arch' to get the architecture identifier easily for
    installation and makefiles

  * New implementation of copy_term/2 that shares common compound
    sub-terms.

  * Totally new foreign language interface using `term-references' to
    allow for garbage collection and stack-shifts with active foreign
    code.  Ported all foreign predicates to the new interface.  This
    interface also allows for generating multiple alternatives for
    a Prolog goal from C.

    For compatibility with old foreign code, see README.oldforeign.

  * FIXED: optimised compilation of A is X (i.e. second argument is
    a variable).

  * COMPILER: improved compilation of floating-point arithmetic using
    -O (optimised), avoiding unnecessary copying of floating point
    numbers to the global stack.

****************************************************************
	     INCOMPATIBLE FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTERFACE
****************************************************************

Version 2.1.15
==============

  * FIXED: read/1 to push the load context when reading end-of-file, so
    the following works:

	term_expansion(end_of_file, end_of_file) :-
	    	prolog_load_context(file, Path),
		format('Finished loading ~w~n', [Path]).

  * FIXED: abolish/2 on imported procedures.  Reported by Peter Barth.

Version 2.1.14
==============

  * DISTRIBUTION: Removed various out-of-date files from the distribution:
    Makefile.win, Makefile.dos, etc.

  * WIN32S: Fixed problem in the garbage collector.

  * WIN32: Improved cputime for NT ('95 and win32s use the old code).

  * MANUAL: Martin Jansche <martin@pc03.idf.uni-heidelberg.de> has send me
    patches for the manual, fixing many smaller and bigger mistakes in it.
    Thanks!

  * DEBUG: Added stuff for debugging for different memory models on Unix
    machines with an mmap() that can map memory at the addresses normally
    used by the target machine.  See morecore.c

Version 2.1.13
==============

  * WIN32: Fixed error reporting of shell/1.

  * FIXED: added a flush() after completing the user-query.  This gives
    better output for ?- write(hello).

  * FIXED: file-name conversion cache management.  This cache is used
    by absolute_file_name/3.

Version 2.1.12
==============

  * Most of these fixed after comments from David Plummer.  Thanks.

  * FIXED: displayq for ','(...)

  * FIXED: read/1 and friends to handle {}(..) and [](...) correctly.

  * FIXED: format/[2,3] to be able to write unlimited-length output,
    provided there are no `pending' ~t's.

  * COMPAT: absolute_file/3 to accept list of access-modes

  * MODIFIED: access_file/2 to succeed on write and append mode if the
    file does not exist, but the directory can be written.

  * FIXED: unification order in translating grammar --> {goal}.  Noted
    by Andreas Steiner.

  * FIXED: Temporary-buffer management in Svfprintf() and friends.

Version 2.1.11
==============

  * FIXED: functor(X, 8, 0) to yield X = 8.

  * DELETED: library_directory(.).  Gives too much problems because the
    system picks wrong files or directories.

Version 2.1.10
==============

  * ISO: added compliant open/4 predicate.

  * Moved all printing of the system (banner, prompt and warnings to
    use user_error (=stderr) rather than user_output (=stdout), so
    it becomes easier to use Prolog's standard output.  Stderr is
    unbuffered, several predicates that will output more than one
    character now use a `temporary buffer' to reduce IO-load.

  * ISO: Added arithmetic functions: rem/2, ** (= ^), ceiling (= ceil),
    float/1, float_fractional_part/1, float_integer_part/1, truncate/1,
    sign/1 and round/1 (= integer/1).

  * ISO Syntax: Changed quoted atom and string syntax to support character
    escapes, broken lines, etc.  These changes can be switched off
    using ?- set_feature(character_escapes, false). for backward
    compatibility.

    Also, 0b110, 0xa2 and 0o70 (binary, hexadecimal and octal) number
    representations are now recognised.

  * ISO: Added features bounded, integer_rounding_function, max_arity.

  * WIN32: Various changes to the console: use standard colours and
    font, allow for changing colours.  Bind Control-Z to end-of-file
    (alternative for Control-D, which is still valid).

  * WIN32: `pl state.qlx' now assumes state.qlx is the result of a
    qsave_program/[1,2] and automatically loads the state.  This
    allows for associating states with the emulator.  Also, pl file.pl
    will automatically chdir/1 to the directory containing the file
    and load the file before entering the toplevel.

  * WIN32: Fixed some filename case problems: expand_file_name/2 now
    works case-insensitive.  Comparing files for sorting is done case
    insenstive.

  * WIN32: Command-line breaking now handles "quoted arguments".  Only
    double quotes and no escape (I don't know the Windows'95 escape
    conventions).

  * WIN32: Fixed filename completion from console window.

  * INSTALL: Fixed detection of non-gnu/gnu make

  * FIXED: use_module/1, etc. to import predicates exported using the
    export/1 directive instead of the module/2 directive.

Version 2.1.9
=============

  * FIXED: Updated stack-shifter code for the changed layout of the
    environment-stack frames.  This bug prevented pl-gc.c to compile
    on machines having no virtual-memory based stack allocation.

Version 2.1.8
=============

  * ADDED: check in exit code that removes possibly incomplete .qlf and
    bootfiles if an error occurred while building the file.

  * FIXED: WIN32 tmp_file/2.  This fixes help/1.

  * FIXED: configure for users of a shell that doesn't export $PWD and
    the system chooses the install-sh script.

Version 2.1.7
=============

  * FIXED: management of clause index-table.  Old code lead to indefinite
    growing of these tables with repetative assert/retract

  * ADDED: Improved dirty-management on clause indexing system to improve
    the performance on retract from hashed dynamic predicates.

  * ADDED: absolute_file_name/3: options file_type, file_errors and
    solutions for compatibility.

  * Win32: compiled (with small updates) for Win32

  * ADDED: Implemented open_null_stream/1 by defining a null-stream in
    SWI-Prologs stream-i/o package to avoid the /dev/null dependency.

  * ADDED: Saving current operator declarations with qsave_program/[1,2].

  * FIXED: Garbage-collector error.

  * FIXED: predicate-reference count problem
  
  * ADDED: style_check(+dynamic) to report on manipulation of predicates
    that are active in the interpreter.

Version 2.1.6
=============

  * INSTALL: installs pl in the SWI-Prolog tree and just creates a link
    from the binary directory.  Makes it easier to move and redistribute
    the SWI-Prolog binaries.

  * CHPL.c: fixed conflict for basename()
  
  * FIXED: file-searching cache returning alternate answers in different
    order.

Version 2.1.5
=============

  * ADDED: notrace(+Goal) to run Goal invisible to the debugger.

  * ADDED: open_shared_object/3 to be able to pass flags to dlopen().

  * CLAUSE INDEXING: version 2.1.5 provides hashing to speed up first
    argument indexing.  Numerous changes had to be made to realise this:
    Indirection in the clause chain of predicates, implementation of a
    lazy automatic system to guess the proper way to index a predicate,
    a new clause-reference count system (avoiding problems with manipulation
    of `active' predicates.  The representation of predicate and clauses
    has changed in various ways.

  * INSTALL: Changed various things to the configure options and detection,
    to the defaults make more sence.  Upgraded to autoconf 2.4, fixed for
    cross-compilation.

  * PORT: Fixed various things for the Linux/ELF port.  Tested on
    Linux 1.2.13 running libc-5.0.9.  Compiled with gcc-2.7.0.

  * PERFORMANCE: Implemented automatic rehashing of all (previously)
    fixed-size hash-tables.  Prevents performance degradation on very
    large programs.

  * FIXED: profile/3 problem (leading to crashes).

  * FIXED: pl -O bug: trailing of is/2 was not handled properly.

Version 2.1.4
=============

  * MODIFIED: Changed definition of absolute_file_name/2.  Moved
    absolute_file_name/3 from library(quintus) to a built-in predicate.

  * ADDED: file_directory_name/2 and file_base_name/2.

  * ADDED: end_of_file is now passed to term_expansion/2.

  * DOC: Many updates.

  * FIXED: read/1 for foo.%comment (i.e. no space between the . and the
    comment).  Note that foo./*comment*/ doesn't work as this will be
    tokenised as `foo', `./*', `comment', `*/'.

  * ADDED: lazy recomputation of clause indexing.  This notably speeds
    up loading .qlf and bootfiles.

  * ADDED: hash_term/2 for advanced indexing of databases.

  * ADDED: setting file_search_path through the command line using:
    pl -p mydir=/foo/bar.

  * FIXED: Semantics of ensure_loaded/1 if the file is already loaded,
    combined with the module system.  See ensure_loaded/1.

  * FIXED: Grammar rule compiler's handling of non-proper lists in the
    head or body (lists ending in a variable).  Lists of more then one
    element are now translated into append/3.  The following now compiles
    ok: string([H|T]) --> [H|T].

  * MODIFIED: term_to_atom/2 and atom_to_term/3 to fail silently on a
    syntax error.  Both predicates now also accept a string in the place
    of the atom to parse strings: term_to_atom(X, "foo(bar)") works as
    expected.

  * ADDED: `swi' and `foreign' aliases to file_search_path/2.

  * MODIFIED: Grammar rule translator now uses 'C'/3 instead of '$char'/3
    to extract the head.  Compatibility.

  * MODIFIED: at_initialisation/1 is now called at_initialization/1.

  * INSTALL: Fixed Makefile and configure to be able to build the system
    for multiple platforms.

  * ADDED: Infra-structure for making portable saved-states (equivalents
    of boot files):

	+ initialization/1	(goals to run at initialization)
	+ volatile/1		(predicates for which not to save clauses)
	+ require/1		(define we require this predicate)
	+ autoload/[0,1]	(autoload needed things now)
	+ qsave_program/[1,2]	(make a quick-loadable state)

  * ADDED: compound/1 to test for compound terms.

  * FIXED: compilation of ``foo:Head :- Body'' to be equivalent to
    foo:(Head :- Body).

  * FIXED: problem in read/1 and number_chars/2 that may have lead to 
    garbage collection errors.

  * FIXED: setarg/3 integrated in the trail-system.  Removes its
    choicepoint and ensures data consistency.

Version 2.1.3
=============

  * ADDED: setarg/3 for extra-logical assignment to arguments of terms.

  * MODIFIED: PL_new_integer() now returns a floating point value if the
    argument exceeds SWI-Prolog's integer range.

  * ADDED: Automatically dumps the top of the runtime stack on floating
    point exceptions.

  * FIXED: Trap floating point exceptions for the win32 version.

Version 2.1.2
=============

  * FIXED: read/1 problem.  Try reading just '0'. ...  Reported by
    Daniela Genius.

  * FIXED: `toplevel' variable expansion system, leading to various strange
    behaviours in handling queries from the user.  It now can also handle
    cases as:

    	?- X = 5.
	?- X is $X + 1.

Version 2.1.1
=============

  * MODIFIED: DCG translation of free variables now calls phrase/3, which
    has been changed slightly to deal with `un-parsing'.  Modification
    is probably not complete, but it fixes some problems encountered by
    Michael Boehlen.

  * MODIFIED: keysort/2 is now stable with regard to multiple values on
    the same key.  Makes this predicate compatible with SICStus and
    Quintus.

  * FIXED: :- dynamic, :- multifile, :- module_transparent and
    :- discontiguous to accept Module:Name/Arity, ...

  * Moved call/[1..] into the compiler.  call/[1..6] is removed from
    library(quintus) as it is now part of the base system. Also fail/0
    and true/0 are now handled by virtual machine instructions.

  * Upgrade to autoconf 2.3, fixed usage of `tr' for Solaris 2.x and
    with that the configuration of --enable-shared.

  * FIXED: number_chars/2 and name/2 now handle floating point numbers.

  * FIXED: interaction between chdir/1 and absolute_file_name/2.

  * FIXED: format('~*c', [10,45]) (or more in general, providing an argument
    to ~c to print the character multiple times).  Thanks to Michael Boehlen.

  * FIXED: PrologPrompt() to allow reading standard input from the -g and/or
    -t goal options.

Version 2.1.0
==============

  * Added facilities to allow for embedding SWI-Prolog in C applications.

  * Fixed semantics of the cut in toplevel queries by compiling the query
    instead of using meta-call.

  * Fixed bagof(A, member([B, C]), L) to yield L = [B,C] instead of making
    new variables.

  * Fixed typo in dde.pl (reported by Thiebaut Moeglin)

  * Integration of NeXT patches from Thomas Hoppe (hoppet@cs.tu-berlin.de).
    Probably still not 100% ok, but should be closer now.

  * Fixed XPCE event dispatching for pl -tty

  * PL_univg() C-interface function added for supporting XPCE > 4.8.10
    with better interface performance.

  * Fixed operator precedence problem (reported by Dave Moffat)

Version 2.0.9
=============

  * ADDED: HPUX interface for shared libraries, but a HPUX guru should
    fix the import/export details (line was too slow to browse to lots
    of manual pages).

  * FIXED: pl-incl.h typo (breaks IRIX 5.3 port and propably others)

  * FIXED: HPUX detection of mmap()'able stacks fixed.

  * FIXED: generation of include/SWI-Exports, the AIX export declaration
    file.

Version 2.0.8
=============

  * FIXED: loading shared objects using dlopen() for solaris 2.x
  
  * FIXED: shlib.pl current_foreign_library/2 administration.

Version 2.0.7
=============

  * FIXED: compilation (boot and .qlf) now donot look for compiled
    (.qlf) files.

  * CHANGED: Default goal writing the banner is now in the flag
    $banner_goal (used by XPCE as a shared library).


Version 2.0.6
=============

  * CHANGED: retractall/1 implementation is now compatible to Quintus,
    avoiding the hacky redefinition in library(quintus.pl).  The difference
    is that now the argument will only be matched against the clause-head.
    on a match the clause will be removed, regardless of its body.  Makes
    no difference for retractall on facts, but does make a difference on
    clauses with a non-just-true body.  retractall/1 is now a deterministic
    foreign predicate that no longer decompiles the clause body, making
    it faster too.

  * FIXED: made .qlf files independent of the directory they where compiled.

  * FIXED: Path canonisation problem

  * FIXED: loading .qlf files holding already-defined modules

  * ADDED: file_search_path file-location system

  * ADDED: access_file(File, exists) to check for bare existence.

  * FIXED: Another clear_uninitialised() problem related to if-then-else
    causing garbage collector and possibly stack-shift errors.  As the
    implementation is now changed radically, this problem should be gone
    forever ...

  * FIXED: copy_term/2.  Now creates more efficient terms (less references)
    and no longer creates bad references.

Version 2.0.5
=============

  * MODIFIED: Replaced libc based stream IO with more general IOSTREAM
    package.  Deleted folding capabilities as just about any IO device
    has these built-in these days.  These changes are to facilate embedding
    in window-based environments that do not support stdio.  See pl-stream.c

  * FIX: dwim_match/2 for single character mismatch.

  * ADDED: atom_chars/2, number_chars/2, atom_char/2, various new
    unix/1 arguments.

Version 2.0.4
=============

  * MODIFIED: Consult and friends (ensure_loaded, use_module, etc.)
    no longer change directory to the directory in which the file
    lives.  As a consequence, directives have to use prolog_load_context/2
    or source_location/2 to find the context directory of the directive.

    consult and related directives still load relative to the directory
    in which the currently loading file lives.

  * Added prolog_load_context/2 to provide context for directives.
    Actually moved from library(quintus) to the boot image as the
    predicate is now necessary.

  * Added -DO_RUNTIME support to make a version	that is more suitable
    for distribution of products: no profiling, no tracer, no readline
    and no interrupt handling.  Setup using configure --enable-runtime

Version 2.0.3
=============

  * Fixed: loading qlf files now push the source context while running
    a directive, so source_location/2 should work while executing a
    directive from a .qlf file.
  * Fixed: recognise MAP_ANONYMOUS for configuring mmap() based stacks.
  * Added feature(dynamic_stacks, Bool) for detection of virtual memory
    based stack management.
  * Fixed feature(open_shared_object, Bool) (Michael Kauschke)

Version 2.0.2
=============

  * Fixed pl [options] -c file ...
  * Improved VMI implementation for (if -> then ; else), \+ and (a;b).
    Reduces overhead of these to about 1/3th.
  * Added VMI support for fast calling of foreign system predicates that
    are called with only variable arguments (i.e. `test(X) :- integer(X)'
    is optimised; `test(X) :- integer(3)' is not).  Provides big speedup
    for fail, true, integer/1 (etc.), and many other commonly called
    foreign predicates.
  * Support for mmap() using MAP_ANON.  Avoids a file-descriptor and hopefully
    improves portability of dynamic stacks.
  * Fix for Solaris 2.4 mmap() detection.
  * Fix: added autoconf test for using asm("nop") in pl-wam.c or use slower
    but more portable C alternative (fixes RS/6000 version)

Version 2.0.1
=============

  * FIX in garbage collector of 2.0.0 was only half the story.  Should
    be ok now.  Thanks to Thomas Hoppe for supplying me with the error
    report.
  * FIX & performance: current_functor/2 with the first argument is
    instantiated.
  * Installation: the libraries are now installed as
    $(prefix)/lib/$(PL)-$(PLVERSION).  A possibly existing executable is moved
    from $(prefix)/bin/$(PL) to $(prefix)/bin/$(PL).old


Version 2.0.0
=============

  * Added `Quick Load File' compilation support.  See qcompile/1 and
    qload/1.  Alpha stage.
  * FIXED infrequent segmentation violation occurring on machines with
    dynamic stack management, but whose signal handler is not provided
    the address of the fault (Linux and Solaris 2 for example).  The
    crash can be in various foreign predicates that use the local stack
    as scratch area.
  * Important FIX to the garbage collector.  This bug may happen iff
    a garbage collection is invoked while clauses are active that have
    \+ or (a -> b ; c) constructs that are not yet active.  Generally
    the problem is reported as an inconsistency in the relocation count.
  * Fix to virtual machine encoding that applies to versions compiled
    with gcc 2.x and whose text-space starts at a high address.
  * Modified absolute_file_name/2 to take specifications of the
    form absolute_file_name(library('shell.pl'), X).
  * Various fixes to the new .qlf format and support for compiliation 
    of individual or combined sources into .qlf files.  .qlf files may
    now be loaded as normal sourcefiles instead of only as `boot' file.


Version 1.9.6:
==============

  * Fixed for BIG_ENDIAN machines (Intel, VAX, ...)
  * Windows version: added dde_execute/2
  * Added Quintus compatible foreign-language (C) interface.
  * Changed .qlf (former .wic) format drastically.  The current
    format gives about 30% shorter files and loads twice as fast.
  * Changed basic clause representation.  VM op-codes are now
    full machine words, avoiding the need for the `XR' table
    management and related indirections.  Simplifies the instruction set,
    speedup for compiler, decompiler (retract, clause) and execution
    (about 10%).  Enlarges program-size with about 10%.


Version 1.9.5:
==============

alpha-2

  * Fixed prolog_frame_attribute/3 for key=parent.
  * Added at_initialisation(+Goal) for initialisation hooks
  * Fixed tracer problems introduced in 1.9.5-alpla-1.


alpha-1

  * Moved sourcecode administration from predicate to individual
    clauses.  Purpose: better source-level debugger support, better
    handling of multifile predicates.

  * Recompiling files holding clauses for multifile predicates now
    works properly. The clauses of the latest loaded file will
    always be the last.

  * Removing a predicate from a file and recompiling the file
    now actually removes the definition from the Prolog database,
    even if you are not using modules.

  * Added prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, clause, ClauseRef) to get a
    reference to the currently running clause.

  * Added clause_property/2 to get the source information from a 
    specific clause.

  * Compiled state (-c compilation) has changed a little.  The system
    does not load old states.


Version 1.9.4.  Redefining system-predicates is no longer allowed.  This
may be overruled using  :-   redefine_system_predicate(+Head).   Fix  in
Makefile (from Kayvan Sylvan): fixes shell   syntax  error make install.
Give warning on user-files trying  to   load  module  `user' or `system'
(this is why library(system) could not   be loaded).  Fixed whereis/1 to
find locations of predicates.   Fixed   trace/[1,2]  to  avoid low-level
errors on bad specifications.  Specification now   also  accept the much
more natural ?- trace(append, fail).  as a shorthand for [+fail].  Added
autoloader handling to ed/1, listing/1, spy/1 and trace/2.  Manipulating
not-yet-loaded autoload predicates will trap the autoloader.  Added hook
for help-system, so we provide a   decent help-window when running under
the XPCE graphical environment.  The   hook  is called show_help_file/2.
Fixed  rename_file/2  (bug  introduced  in  pl-1.9.2).   Fixed  versions
Windows-specific problems.  Added  prolog_to_os_filename/2   to  convert
between internal and external names (DOS/Windows).  Integrated the 1.9.4
patches for the Windows  version.   Fixed   to  compile  on  AIX.  Fixed
compilation on some Solaris version.

Version  1.9.3.   Fix  index/1  problem    introduced   in  1.9.2.   Fix
stack-expansion problem in all versions that   lack hardware support for
stack-expansion.  Some cleanup in pl-gc.c to make clean compilation with
-Wall  and  -DO_DEBUG  possible.   Regenerated   common  prototype  file
pl-funcs.h using mkproto tool (and some editing).

Version 1.9.2.  Configuration is  now  based   on  GNU's  autoconf.  All
md-*.h files have been removed from  the distribution.  $arch/2, $home/1
and $version/1 have been replaced by feature/2.  A predicate read_link/3
has been added to read symbolic links.   Installation is tested on SunOs
4.1.3, Solaris 2.3 and Linux 1.0.9 with readline 2.0.3.

Version 1.9.1.  Added: Windows DDE   interface,  Added Unix/System-V (?)
interface to dlopen() and friends to access shared objects dynamically.

Version 1.9.0.  Incorporation of various  ports: md-netbsd.h, md-mswin.h
and  md-msdos.h.   There  is  a  binary   distribution  for  Windows  in
win-pl.tgz of the main ftp server (swi.psy.uva.nl).  The DOS and Windows
versions are created using the WATCOM-C/32 toolkit.


=======================================================================
Version 1.8.12.  Fixed tracer option `f' (fail) used on the exit port of
a goal.  Thanks to Thomas Hoppe.

Version 1.8.8.  Fix  in  the  parser   to  avoid  some  bad syntax-error
messages.  Also fixed spurious crashes   trying to read bad-syntax-terms
of the form ?- atom,.

New in the quintus.pl library:  initialization/1, random/3, numbervars/3
and absolute_file_name/3.

Version  1.8.7  includes   the    catch/throw-like   control  structures
block(+Label,  +Goal,  -Rval),  fail(+Label),  exit(+Label,  +Rval)  and
!(+Label).  Also new is explain(+Anything) which will  try to tell you a
lot of what the system knows about  the term you entered.  Additions and
suggesions are welcome.  Also new: library(bim): A partial Prolog-by-BIM
(tm) compatibility package by Henk Vandecasteele.  Thanks.

Further fixes:

	* Bug in detecting stack-overflow for the PC/linux version.
	* Handling of SWI_HOME_DIR (fixes installation problem for
 	  XPCE/SWI-Prolog).
	* atom_length/2: give warning (instead of crash) on invalid
	  data-type (e.g. unbound, term).
	* nth_clause/3: Removed errornous warning when cut-off and
	  fixed returning 0-reference for defined predicates without
	  clauses.

Version 1.8.6 defines phrase/[2,3] for accessing grammar rules and fixes
name/2 for numbers outside the  integer   range  (yielding  a float).  A
predicate nth_clause/3 is added to provide access to specific clauses of
predicates.  xmalloc(), xrealloc() are added to   fix some problems when
linking with gnu-libraries.

Version 1.8.5 contains a few fixes  for the SunOs-4/gcc-2.5 combination.
DONOT USE GCC-2.5.[123] as the optimiser   appears broken.  gcc-2.5.4 is
ok again.

Version 1.8.4 fixes =@=/2, contains a more  logical form of arg/3, fixes
passing empty-string arguments from the   Prolog  command-line and fixes
some things for old non-ansi compilers.    There  are some extensions to
the quintus.pl compatibility library.

Version 1.8.3 Fixes some  more  readline   problems  having  to  do with
running SWI-Prolog as an inferior process under EMACS.

Version 1.8.2 fixes some serious  problems   in  the tracer intoduced by
more global changes in 1.8.0.

Version 1.8.1 fixes load_foreign for  both   SunOs  4.1.3  and PC/Linux.
Extensive use of the stat(2) system call is reduced with some changes to
the file administration.  This speeds up loading  many small files by an
incredible amount, notably when reading over a (slow) network.

The manual is  regenerated.   There  are   not  many  changes,  but  the
PostScript files in these archives are  totally different as we upgrated
LaTeX and dvips.  Therefore  the   patch  file **diff-1.8.0-1.8.1** does
*not* include the patches to the PostScript manual.

Version 1.8.0 includes a stack  shifter,   enabling  dynamic  stacks for
machines that do not offer hardware support by providing suitable access
to  the  virtual  memory  management.    Fixed    a   bug  in  concat/3.
expand_file/2 is now sensitive to fileerrors/2   while expanding $var or
~user.   More  bugfixes  to  the    readline   interface.   Manual  page
contributed by Dave Sherrat.   RS6000  port   no  longer  uses -lbsd and
compiles on gcc.

================================================================
Version 1.7.2 should compile on Solaris 2.2   using gcc 2.4.5.  It fixes
the usual couple of portability problems,   the  terminal interface when
connected  to  the  XPCE  graphics  library.     It  ads  line_count  to
predicate_property to support a future graphical debugging tool.

Version 1.7.1 fixes a very serious   memory  allocation violation in the
connection to the readline library.  Make sure to update from 1.7.0!

Version 1.7.0 contains a version linked   with  the GNU readline library
for  bash/tcsh  compatible  line  editing.    The  library  readline  is
distributed separately and must be   installed before installing prolog.
The  file  readline-1.1.tar.gz  contains  the  unmodified  GNU  sources.
librl-1.1.tar.z contains the binaries for PC/Linux.

================================================================
Version 1.6.18 contains a fix to load_foreign/[2,5] for PC/Linux.

[Version 1.6.17 has been reinstalled at Jun  1 23:16 with two prototype
fixes and a fix to save_program/1 necessary for the RS6000.]

Version 1.6.17 fixes  some  minor   installation  problems  reported for
1.6.16.  The online manual has been   updated for trace/[1,2].  Callback
of undefined Prolog-predicates from C now correctly trap the autoloader.
Analysis of the PATH variable to  find   the  Prolog executable has been
fixed.  Nothing serious if you have a running system!

Version 1.6.16 integrates port to 386  System-V   Unix  made  by Eric S.
Raymond (esr@snark.thyrsus.com), who also ported   the  shell scripts to
use sh rather than csh.  The new   predicates  trace/1 and trace/2 allow
for tracing individual predicates non-interactively.

Version 1.6.15  eliminates  some  compiler  limits,   fixes  a  bug  in
trail-stacks management and provides a much   better  port for PC/Linux.
Requires Linux kernel 99pl7 or later.

Version 1.6.14 provides 8 bit character  support.  All characters in the
range 128 ...  255 are treated as   lowercase letters.  op/3 is fixed to
actually delete operators when priority 0 is specified.

Version 1.6.13 implements  standard  order   compatible  to  Quintus and
contains  a  fix  of  the  module  system  which  broke  the  Quintus.pl
replacement of retractall/1.

Version 1.6.12 is te result of  integrating   ports  to  LINUX, OS/2 and
HP/UX with the main-stream (SunOs).
