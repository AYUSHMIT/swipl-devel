SWI-Prolog 5.1.2/XPCE 6.1.2 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 3th beta-release.  Suitable for research and development.
    Discouraged for production usage.  It has a few 5.0.10 bugs
    fixed but surely introduced new ones.


SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Added thread_statistics/3: get statistics on other threads.
    
  * Fixed a large number of multithreaded I/O locking issues, something
    that would never have succeeded without help from Sergey Tikhonov.
    Seems most pressing problems in this area are now resolved.

  * Fixed important bug in negative integer context of non-deterministic
    foreign code (result from new representation in 5.1.x).

  * Fixes to abort (exceptions), listing, and many more.

  * Fixed wait_for_input/3 on Windows 2000 machines, as well as for
    other architectures with many open I/O channals.


Packages
========

  * ODBC: Fixed silent operation of odbc_connect.

  * CLIB: Added library(rlimit), providing access to the POSIX
    resource limitations (limit memory, filesize, CPUtime, etc).

  * XPCE: Fixed incremental GC leaking objects.


Development environment
=======================

  * More flexible presentation of variable-bindings in the GUI debugger.


Short-term Plans
================

  * More RDF/RDFS/OWL handling

  * More multi-threading support (thread-monitor, debugging, etc).

  * Some ODBC issues
 
  * Resolve Java interface issues
