SWI-Prolog 5.1.9/XPCE 6.1.9 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 11th beta-release.  Considering feedback, the 5.1.x series probably becomes
    mainstream not too far from here.

    This version provides the missing link to use the same Prolog engine
    from multiple foreign threads (M threads can use N engines).  See
    PL_set_engine() and friends in the reference manual.  Threading in
    JPL (Java interface) should use this.  Currently only the Java 
    thread that created SWI-Prolog can use it.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Get Richard O'Keefs fast `natural-merge' sort to replace sort,
    msort and keysort.  Saves space on the first 2 and a huge performance
    gain on keysort.

  * PORT: Better detection of required mmap() infrastructure and deal with
    IRIX style MAP_AUTOGROW maps.  Provides mmap-based stacks for more
    platforms.

  * ADDED: Make it possible for signals to break blocking (I/O) calls.  This
    makes it possible to use call_with_time_limit/2 on socket operations and
    more.  This mechanism is not yet exploited for all operations where it
    makes sense.

  * Quite a few minor patches.

Packages
========

Development environment
=======================

  * Handle aborts more gracefully (still not perfect).

  * Print human-readable exceptions in the GUI-Tracer.

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Resolve Java interface issues (Linking issues and related to the above).

Donations
=========

Donations, small and big, are well appreciated, as are critisism and plans
to turn SWI-Prolog in a self-supporting project.  Please visit
