SWI-Prolog 5.1.7/XPCE 6.1.7 Summary of changes

Status
======
  
  * 8th beta-release.  Considering feedback, the 5.1.x series probably becomes
    mainstream not too far from here.

    Remaining issues are exploiting the multi-threaded version in a
    multi-threaded foreign environment, which is currently incompatible
    to using the single threaded version.

SWI-Prolog
==========

  * Fixed reported problems.  Minor enhancements

Packages
========

  * XPCE: object-reference problems with colours in the X11 version (could
    crash system).

  * SGML: bug in call-back mode interface.

  * RDF: MODIFIED call-back mode interface, which now passes an extra
    argument holding File:Line where the triples originate from.

  * CLIB: fixed call_with_time_limit/2

Development environment
=======================

  * Various minor improvements

Short-term Plans
================

  * RDF storage and RDFS and OWL query support.

  * Provide support for N Prolog engines in M threads (N>=1, M>=1).

  * Resolve Java interface issues (Linking issues and related to the above)

Donations
=========

Donations, small and big, are well appreciated, as are critisism and plans
to turn SWI-Prolog in a self-supporting project.  Please visit
