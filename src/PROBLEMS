Remaining problems in SWI-Prolog

* The standard loaded library facilities get a bit of a mess.  A
  better idea might be to take out many of the functions and use dynamic
  library loading instead.  Another idea is to put the entire system in
  a module called system, so the user can abolish it whenever appropriate,
  without cripling the system itself.

* Still, we have to search for a solution to garbage collection
  while foreign code is active.

* Read/1 is buggy.  Operator resolution still does not solve all problems
  correctly.

  	?- op(900, fy, cd).
	
	cd :- cd ~.

  is read as cd (:- cd ~).
