.SH NAME
plld \- Create a SWI-Prolog embedded executable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR plld
.BI "options" " " "c-files" " " "o-files" 
.BI "pl-files"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The utility
.BI plld
is a front-end for the C-compiler and linker to create a stand-alone
executable from a series of C-compiler input files and Prolog input
files.  It extracts information from the SWI-Prolog executable
.BI pl
, after which it scans the arguments and breaks them into several
categories.  It will then call the C-compiler to create an executable
containing the user's C-code and the SWI-Prolog kernel.  After this,
it will call the development environment to create a Prolog saved
state from the prolog files and finally it will create the target
executable by concatenating the state to the emulator.  See also
.BI qsave_program/2
from the
.BI SWI-Prolog " " manual.

.SS Options
.TP
.BI \-pl " prolog"
Specifies the prolog version to use.  The default is
.BI pl.
This flag may be used to choose between different versions installed
on your system, or to specify a modified version.  A modified version
should understands the flags
.BI \-dump-runtime-variables
.BI \-f " file"
.BI \-F " file"
.BI \-g " goal"
.BI \-t " toplevel".
.TP
.BI \-help
Shows options briefly
.TP
.BI \-v
Verbose operation.  This will echo the commands before executing them.
.BI \-o " file"
Specifies the name of the final executable.  The default is
.BI a.out.
.TP
.BI \-l "library"
Specifies a C-library for linking the application.  By default,
.BI -lpl
as well as the libraries required by the SWI-Prolog kernel will be
passed to the C-compiler.
.TP
.BI \-L "library-directory"
Specifies an additional library directory for the C-compiler.  By
default, the runtime directory for the current architecture is passed.
.TP
.BI \-g|-I*|-D*
Passed to the compiler as c-flags.  By default, the SWI-Prolog include
directory is passed as additional include directory.
.TP
.BI *.o|*.c|*.C|*.cxx|*.cpp
Passed as C-input files.
.TP
.BI *.pl|*.qlf
Passed as Prolog input files
.TP
.BI *
I.e. all other flags.  These are passed as linker options to the
C-compiler.
.SH BUGS
Parsing the options and distributing them over the various programs is
probably incomplete.
.BI plld
is a Bourne shell script.  Feel free to modify it and please forward
generally useful modifications to
.BI prolog-bugs@swi.psy.uva.nl.

Some care has to be taken that the state created with
.BI qsave_program/2
is self-contained (i.e. contains no references to the Prolog libraries).
Also, as the state is created using the development environment rather
then the user's emulator, the Prolog code cannot use directives that
rely on the C-code added by the user.
