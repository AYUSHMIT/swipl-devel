---+ The SWI-Prolog operating-system and basic operation layer

This directory contains parts of  SWI-Prolog   that  deal with operating
system and file access as well as core functionality to support this.

---++ Deploying this code

Although this code is repacked  to   make  deployment outside SWI-Prolog
possible, this is not a trivial process. You need to do the following:

  * Provide a SWI-Prolog compatible implementation of the required bits
  of the foreign language interface.  These functions are called PL_*
  and described in the SWI-Prolog manual.

  * Provide an emulation for pl-codelist.[ch], pl-privitf.[ch] and
  pl-builtin.h. These files provide macros and functions that access
  (SWI-)Prolog internals directly. Hopefully your Prolog system can do
  something similar.

  * Provide an emulation for pl-incl.h.
  TBD: We must move those parts of pl-incl.h that are really neaded into
  pl-builtin.h, so the dependencies on pl-incl.h disappear.

  * The constants ATOM_* are SWI-Prolog macros that define objects of
  type atom_t refering to a specific string.  The script atoms.sh in
  this directory can be used to extract the atoms that are used in this
  directory. This only works if the atom-definition file ATOMS of
  SWI-Prolog is available as ../ATOMS.
