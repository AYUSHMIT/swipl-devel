SWI-Prolog 5.5.38/XPCE 6.5.38 development release

Planned features in 5.5.x relative to 5.4.x and their status
============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings
	- Changed built-in predicates to deal with this transparently
	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.
	- Support for BOM (Byte Order Marker) for UNICODE and UTF-8 files.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Incomplete support in packages
		- ODBC
			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all
		- XPCE
			- Limited XIM support for X11 version
			- No input method support in Windows version

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Provide 64-bit integers, also for 32-bit platforms.
	- Added GMP support
	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

	- Realise full compatibility of 32- and 64-bit saved states.
	- Possible alignment problems on some platforms
	- Option to disable it on platforms that cannot support it.

Patches in 5.5.38 relative to 5.5.37
====================================

 * Fixed crash in meta-calling huge goals.
 * Some input fixes: avoid loosing next character after abort and
   memory leak in readline interface.
 * Added Encoding negotiation with external streams.
 * Fixed numbervars/ignore_ops interaction error in write_term.

Packages
========
 
 * XPCE: Use encoding negotiation to allow changing encoding on Prolog
   streams related to XPCE sockets.
 * SemWeb: Fix saving triple-sets using datatypes.
 * HTTP: Avoid XPCE based servers to be garbage collected when started
   from the GUI.

Incompatible changes
====================
