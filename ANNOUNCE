SWI-Prolog 5.0.5/XPCE 6.0.5 Summary of changes

SWI-Prolog
==========

    * ENGINE: fix to call_cleanup/[2,3]: avoid GC when running cleanup
      handler.  PL_cons_functor_v() now does proper dereferencing, avoiding
      some weird errors on specific use of the C/C++ interface.

    * COMPATIBILITY:   Added, depending on the flag backquoted_string,
      support for LPA-Prolog string syntax (`hello world`).  Again allow
      for `interleaved I/O' using Edinburgh tell/1 and see/1.  See manual.

    * PORTABILITY: BeOS and Compaq C-compiler, various minor improvements
      to configure and build-suite.

    * WINDOWS: support wheel-mouse in plwin.exe, make home/end keys work
      properly.  Provide support for UNC filenames (\\host\share\...,
      preferably written as //host/share/...).

    * MULTI-THREADING: Various patches avoiding corruption and deadlocks.
      Lots of work done by Sergey Tikhonov.  Thanks!

    * DOCS: Various updates.


Development Environment
=======================

    * Modified interface for choice-points, paving the route for further
      improvements and for now avoiding a crash on some specific code.

XPCE
====

    * Allow exchanging atoms and strings betweem XPCE and Prolog containing
      0-bytes.

    * Windows: provide support for UNC filenames (see Prolog).

    * Various minor patches and enhancements
