============================================================

  * UNICODE support

      Realised
      --------

	- Realised kernel representation of wide atoms and strings

	- Added encoding property on streams, allowing for

		- ISO Latin-1
		- C-library default multibyte encoding
		- UTF-8
		- UNICODE (LE/BE)

	- Updated the MS-Windows console (plwin.exe/plterm.dll) to run
	  in MS UNICODE mode
	- Updated `XOS' layer around MS-Windows to access Windows UNICODE
	  filenames through UTF-8 encoding.
	- Support wide characters in SGML/XML parser.
	- Support wide characters in most of XPCE.

			- No support at all
		- JPL
			- No support at all

  * More constraint libraries

	- Received clp(r): Constraint Logic Programming over Reals by
	  Leslie De Koninck, K.U. Leuven, supervised by Bart Demoen and
	  Tom Schrijvers.

	  This library is added to the default installation.  Should be
	  considered beta code.

  * Wider integers

	- Tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

      Lacking
      -------

Patches in 5.5.30 relative to 5.5.29
====================================

 * Fixed reloading running sourcefiles as well as files running in other
   threads.
 * Added new library: nb_set, providing non-backtrackable sets of terms
 * Unicode bug in 'xyz \c  more'


Packages
========
 
 * SemWeb: added rdf_current_predicate/1.  Much faster analysis of 
   required entity definitions for save and allow passing the required
   entities to avoid this step altogether.

 * XPCE: Added library(print_graphics), method ->save_postscript

  (none)
