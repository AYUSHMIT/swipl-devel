			SWI-Prolog ChangeLog
			====================

Version 2.1.4
=============

  * FIXED: problem in read/1 and number_chars/2 that may have lead to 
    garbage collection errors.

  * FIXED: setarg/3 to be integrated in the trail-system.  Removes its
    choicepoint and ensures data consistency.

Version 2.1.3
=============

  * ADDED: setarg/3 for extra-logical assignment to arguments of terms.

  * MODIFIED: PL_new_integer() now returns a floating point value if the
    argument exceeds SWI-Prolog's integer range.

  * ADDED: Automatically dumps the top of the runtime stack on floating
    point exceptions.

  * FIXED: Trap floating point exceptions for the win32 version.

Version 2.1.2
=============

  * FIXED: read/1 problem.  Try reading just '0'. ...  Reported by
    Daniela Genius.

  * FIXED: `toplevel' variable expansion system, leading to various strange
    behaviours in handling queries from the user.  It now can also handle
    cases as:

    	?- X = 5.
	?- X is $X + 1.

Version 2.1.1
=============

  * MODIFIED: DCG translation of free variables now calls phrase/3, which
    has been changed slightly to deal with `un-parsing'.  Modification
    is probably not complete, but it fixes some problems encountered by
    Michael Boehlen.

  * MODIFIED: keysort/2 is now stable with regard to multiple values on
    the same key.  Makes this predicate compatible with SICStus and
    Quintus.

  * FIXED: :- dynamic, :- multifile, :- module_transparent and
    :- discontiguous to accept Module:Name/Arity, ...

  * Moved call/[1..] into the compiler.  call/[1..6] is removed from
    library(quintus) as it is now part of the base system. Also fail/0
    and true/0 are now handled by virtual machine instructions.

  * Upgrade to autoconf 2.3, fixed usage of `tr' for Solaris 2.x and
    with that the configuration of --enable-shared.

  * FIXED: number_chars/2 and name/2 now handle floating point numbers.

  * FIXED: interaction between chdir/1 and absolute_file_name/2.

  * FIXED: format('~*c', [10,45]) (or more in general, providing an argument
    to ~c to print the character multiple times).  Thanks to Michael Boehlen.

  * FIXED: PrologPrompt() to allow reading standard input from the -g and/or
    -t goal options.

Version 2.1.0
==============

  * Added facilities to allow for embedding SWI-Prolog in C applications.

  * Fixed semantics of the cut in toplevel queries by compiling the query
    instead of using meta-call.

  * Fixed bagof(A, member([B, C]), L) to yield L = [B,C] instead of making
    new variables.

  * Fixed typo in dde.pl (reported by Thiebaut Moeglin)

  * Integration of NeXT patches from Thomas Hoppe (hoppet@cs.tu-berlin.de).
    Probably still not 100% ok, but should be closer now.

  * Fixed XPCE event dispatching for pl -tty

  * PL_univg() C-interface function added for supporting XPCE > 4.8.10
    with better interface performance.

  * Fixed operator precedence problem (reported by Dave Moffat)

Version 2.0.9
=============

  * ADDED: HPUX interface for shared libraries, but a HPUX guru should
    fix the import/export details (line was too slow to browse to lots
    of manual pages).

  * FIXED: pl-incl.h typo (breaks IRIX 5.3 port and propably others)

  * FIXED: HPUX detection of mmap()'able stacks fixed.

  * FIXED: generation of include/SWI-Exports, the AIX export declaration
    file.

Version 2.0.8
=============

  * FIXED: loading shared objects using dlopen() for solaris 2.x
  
  * FIXED: shlib.pl current_foreign_library/2 administration.

Version 2.0.7
=============

  * FIXED: compilation (boot and .qlf) now donot look for compiled
    (.qlf) files.

  * CHANGED: Default goal writing the banner is now in the flag
    $banner_goal (used by XPCE as a shared library).


Version 2.0.6
=============

  * CHANGED: retractall/1 implementation is now compatible to Quintus,
    avoiding the hacky redefinition in library(quintus.pl).  The difference
    is that now the argument will only be matched against the clause-head.
    on a match the clause will be removed, regardless of its body.  Makes
    no difference for retractall on facts, but does make a difference on
    clauses with a non-just-true body.  retractall/1 is now a deterministic
    foreign predicate that no longer decompiles the clause body, making
    it faster too.

  * FIXED: made .qlf files independent of the directory they where compiled.

  * FIXED: Path canonisation problem

  * FIXED: loading .qlf files holding already-defined modules

  * ADDED: file_search_path file-location system

  * ADDED: access_file(File, exists) to check for bare existence.

  * FIXED: Another clear_uninitialised() problem related to if-then-else
    causing garbage collector and possibly stack-shift errors.  As the
    implementation is now changed radically, this problem should be gone
    forever ...

  * FIXED: copy_term/2.  Now creates more efficient terms (less references)
    and no longer creates bad references.

Version 2.0.5
=============

  * MODIFIED: Replaced libc based stream IO with more general IOSTREAM
    package.  Deleted folding capabilities as just about any IO device
    has these built-in these days.  These changes are to facilate embedding
    in window-based environments that do not support stdio.  See pl-stream.c

  * FIX: dwim_match/2 for single character mismatch.

  * ADDED: atom_chars/2, number_chars/2, atom_char/2, various new
    unix/1 arguments.

Version 2.0.4
=============

  * MODIFIED: Consult and friends (ensure_loaded, use_module, etc.)
    no longer change directory to the directory in which the file
    lives.  As a consequence, directives have to use prolog_load_context/2
    or source_location/2 to find the context directory of the directive.

    consult and related directives still load relative to the directory
    in which the currently loading file lives.

  * Added prolog_load_context/2 to provide context for directives.
    Actually moved from library(quintus) to the boot image as the
    predicate is now necessary.

  * Added -DO_RUNTIME support to make a version	that is more suitable
    for distribution of products: no profiling, no tracer, no readline
    and no interrupt handling.  Setup using configure --enable-runtime

Version 2.0.3
=============

  * Fixed: loading qlf files now push the source context while running
    a directive, so source_location/2 should work while executing a
    directive from a .qlf file.
  * Fixed: recognise MAP_ANONYMOUS for configuring mmap() based stacks.
  * Added feature(dynamic_stacks, Bool) for detection of virtual memory
    based stack management.
  * Fixed feature(open_shared_object, Bool) (Michael Kauschke)

Version 2.0.2
=============

  * Fixed pl [options] -c file ...
  * Improved VMI implementation for (if -> then ; else), \+ and (a;b).
    Reduces overhead of these to about 1/3th.
  * Added VMI support for fast calling of foreign system predicates that
    are called with only variable arguments (i.e. `test(X) :- integer(X)'
    is optimised; `test(X) :- integer(3)' is not).  Provides big speedup
    for fail, true, integer/1 (etc.), and many other commonly called
    foreign predicates.
  * Support for mmap() using MAP_ANON.  Avoids a file-descriptor and hopefully
    improves portability of dynamic stacks.
  * Fix for Solaris 2.4 mmap() detection.
  * Fix: added autoconf test for using asm("nop") in pl-wam.c or use slower
    but more portable C alternative (fixes RS/6000 version)

Version 2.0.1
=============

  * FIX in garbage collector of 2.0.0 was only half the story.  Should
    be ok now.  Thanks to Thomas Hoppe for supplying me with the error
    report.
  * FIX & performance: current_functor/2 with the first argument is
    instantiated.
  * Installation: the libraries are now installed as
    $(prefix)/lib/$(PL)-$(PLVERSION).  A possibly existing executable is moved
    from $(prefix)/bin/$(PL) to $(prefix)/bin/$(PL).old


Version 2.0.0
=============

  * Added `Quick Load File' compilation support.  See qcompile/1 and
    qload/1.  Alpha stage.
  * FIXED infrequent segmentation violation occurring on machines with
    dynamic stack management, but whose signal handler is not provided
    the address of the fault (Linux and Solaris 2 for example).  The
    crash can be in various foreign predicates that use the local stack
    as scratch area.
  * Important FIX to the garbage collector.  This bug may happen iff
    a garbage collection is invoked while clauses are active that have
    \+ or (a -> b ; c) constructs that are not yet active.  Generally
    the problem is reported as an inconsistency in the relocation count.
  * Fix to virtual machine encoding that applies to versions compiled
    with gcc 2.x and whose text-space starts at a high address.
  * Modified absolute_file_name/2 to take specifications of the
    form absolute_file_name(library('shell.pl'), X).
  * Various fixes to the new .qlf format and support for compiliation 
    of individual or combined sources into .qlf files.  .qlf files may
    now be loaded as normal sourcefiles instead of only as `boot' file.


Version 1.9.6:
==============

  * Fixed for BIG_ENDIAN machines (Intel, VAX, ...)
  * Windows version: added dde_execute/2
  * Added Quintus compatible foreign-language (C) interface.
  * Changed .qlf (former .wic) format drastically.  The current
    format gives about 30% shorter files and loads twice as fast.
  * Changed basic clause representation.  VM op-codes are now
    full machine words, avoiding the need for the `XR' table
    management and related indirections.  Simplifies the instruction set,
    speedup for compiler, decompiler (retract, clause) and execution
    (about 10%).  Enlarges program-size with about 10%.


Version 1.9.5:
==============

alpha-2

  * Fixed prolog_frame_attribute/3 for key=parent.
  * Added at_initialisation(+Goal) for initialisation hooks
  * Fixed tracer problems introduced in 1.9.5-alpla-1.


alpha-1

  * Moved sourcecode administration from predicate to individual
    clauses.  Purpose: better source-level debugger support, better
    handling of multifile predicates.

  * Recompiling files holding clauses for multifile predicates now
    works properly. The clauses of the latest loaded file will
    always be the last.

  * Removing a predicate from a file and recompiling the file
    now actually removes the definition from the Prolog database,
    even if you are not using modules.

  * Added prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, clause, ClauseRef) to get a
    reference to the currently running clause.

  * Added clause_property/2 to get the source information from a 
    specific clause.

  * Compiled state (-c compilation) has changed a little.  The system
    does not load old states.


Version 1.9.4.  Redefining system-predicates is no longer allowed.  This
may be overruled using  :-   redefine_system_predicate(+Head).   Fix  in
Makefile (from Kayvan Sylvan): fixes shell   syntax  error make install.
Give warning on user-files trying  to   load  module  `user' or `system'
(this is why library(system) could not   be loaded).  Fixed whereis/1 to
find locations of predicates.   Fixed   trace/[1,2]  to  avoid low-level
errors on bad specifications.  Specification now   also  accept the much
more natural ?- trace(append, fail).  as a shorthand for [+fail].  Added
autoloader handling to ed/1, listing/1, spy/1 and trace/2.  Manipulating
not-yet-loaded autoload predicates will trap the autoloader.  Added hook
for help-system, so we provide a   decent help-window when running under
the XPCE graphical environment.  The   hook  is called show_help_file/2.
Fixed  rename_file/2  (bug  introduced  in  pl-1.9.2).   Fixed  versions
Windows-specific problems.  Added  prolog_to_os_filename/2   to  convert
between internal and external names (DOS/Windows).  Integrated the 1.9.4
patches for the Windows  version.   Fixed   to  compile  on  AIX.  Fixed
compilation on some Solaris version.

Version  1.9.3.   Fix  index/1  problem    introduced   in  1.9.2.   Fix
stack-expansion problem in all versions that   lack hardware support for
stack-expansion.  Some cleanup in pl-gc.c to make clean compilation with
-Wall  and  -DO_DEBUG  possible.   Regenerated   common  prototype  file
pl-funcs.h using mkproto tool (and some editing).

Version 1.9.2.  Configuration is  now  based   on  GNU's  autoconf.  All
md-*.h files have been removed from  the distribution.  $arch/2, $home/1
and $version/1 have been replaced by feature/2.  A predicate read_link/3
has been added to read symbolic links.   Installation is tested on SunOs
4.1.3, Solaris 2.3 and Linux 1.0.9 with readline 2.0.3.

Version 1.9.1.  Added: Windows DDE   interface,  Added Unix/System-V (?)
interface to dlopen() and friends to access shared objects dynamically.

Version 1.9.0.  Incorporation of various  ports: md-netbsd.h, md-mswin.h
and  md-msdos.h.   There  is  a  binary   distribution  for  Windows  in
win-pl.tgz of the main ftp server (swi.psy.uva.nl).  The DOS and Windows
versions are created using the WATCOM-C/32 toolkit.


=======================================================================
Version 1.8.12.  Fixed tracer option `f' (fail) used on the exit port of
a goal.  Thanks to Thomas Hoppe.

Version 1.8.8.  Fix  in  the  parser   to  avoid  some  bad syntax-error
messages.  Also fixed spurious crashes   trying to read bad-syntax-terms
of the form ?- atom,.

New in the quintus.pl library:  initialization/1, random/3, numbervars/3
and absolute_file_name/3.

Version  1.8.7  includes   the    catch/throw-like   control  structures
block(+Label,  +Goal,  -Rval),  fail(+Label),  exit(+Label,  +Rval)  and
!(+Label).  Also new is explain(+Anything) which will  try to tell you a
lot of what the system knows about  the term you entered.  Additions and
suggesions are welcome.  Also new: library(bim): A partial Prolog-by-BIM
(tm) compatibility package by Henk Vandecasteele.  Thanks.

Further fixes:

	* Bug in detecting stack-overflow for the PC/linux version.
	* Handling of SWI_HOME_DIR (fixes installation problem for
 	  XPCE/SWI-Prolog).
	* atom_length/2: give warning (instead of crash) on invalid
	  data-type (e.g. unbound, term).
	* nth_clause/3: Removed errornous warning when cut-off and
	  fixed returning 0-reference for defined predicates without
	  clauses.

Version 1.8.6 defines phrase/[2,3] for accessing grammar rules and fixes
name/2 for numbers outside the  integer   range  (yielding  a float).  A
predicate nth_clause/3 is added to provide access to specific clauses of
predicates.  xmalloc(), xrealloc() are added to   fix some problems when
linking with gnu-libraries.

Version 1.8.5 contains a few fixes  for the SunOs-4/gcc-2.5 combination.
DONOT USE GCC-2.5.[123] as the optimiser   appears broken.  gcc-2.5.4 is
ok again.

Version 1.8.4 fixes =@=/2, contains a more  logical form of arg/3, fixes
passing empty-string arguments from the   Prolog  command-line and fixes
some things for old non-ansi compilers.    There  are some extensions to
the quintus.pl compatibility library.

Version 1.8.3 Fixes some  more  readline   problems  having  to  do with
running SWI-Prolog as an inferior process under EMACS.

Version 1.8.2 fixes some serious  problems   in  the tracer intoduced by
more global changes in 1.8.0.

Version 1.8.1 fixes load_foreign for  both   SunOs  4.1.3  and PC/Linux.
Extensive use of the stat(2) system call is reduced with some changes to
the file administration.  This speeds up loading  many small files by an
incredible amount, notably when reading over a (slow) network.

The manual is  regenerated.   There  are   not  many  changes,  but  the
PostScript files in these archives are  totally different as we upgrated
LaTeX and dvips.  Therefore  the   patch  file **diff-1.8.0-1.8.1** does
*not* include the patches to the PostScript manual.

Version 1.8.0 includes a stack  shifter,   enabling  dynamic  stacks for
machines that do not offer hardware support by providing suitable access
to  the  virtual  memory  management.    Fixed    a   bug  in  concat/3.
expand_file/2 is now sensitive to fileerrors/2   while expanding $var or
~user.   More  bugfixes  to  the    readline   interface.   Manual  page
contributed by Dave Sherrat.   RS6000  port   no  longer  uses -lbsd and
compiles on gcc.

================================================================
Version 1.7.2 should compile on Solaris 2.2   using gcc 2.4.5.  It fixes
the usual couple of portability problems,   the  terminal interface when
connected  to  the  XPCE  graphics  library.     It  ads  line_count  to
predicate_property to support a future graphical debugging tool.

Version 1.7.1 fixes a very serious   memory  allocation violation in the
connection to the readline library.  Make sure to update from 1.7.0!

Version 1.7.0 contains a version linked   with  the GNU readline library
for  bash/tcsh  compatible  line  editing.    The  library  readline  is
distributed separately and must be   installed before installing prolog.
The  file  readline-1.1.tar.gz  contains  the  unmodified  GNU  sources.
librl-1.1.tar.z contains the binaries for PC/Linux.

================================================================
Version 1.6.18 contains a fix to load_foreign/[2,5] for PC/Linux.

[Version 1.6.17 has been reinstalled at Jun  1 23:16 with two prototype
fixes and a fix to save_program/1 necessary for the RS6000.]

Version 1.6.17 fixes  some  minor   installation  problems  reported for
1.6.16.  The online manual has been   updated for trace/[1,2].  Callback
of undefined Prolog-predicates from C now correctly trap the autoloader.
Analysis of the PATH variable to  find   the  Prolog executable has been
fixed.  Nothing serious if you have a running system!

Version 1.6.16 integrates port to 386  System-V   Unix  made  by Eric S.
Raymond (esr@snark.thyrsus.com), who also ported   the  shell scripts to
use sh rather than csh.  The new   predicates  trace/1 and trace/2 allow
for tracing individual predicates non-interactively.

Version 1.6.15  eliminates  some  compiler  limits,   fixes  a  bug  in
trail-stacks management and provides a much   better  port for PC/Linux.
Requires Linux kernel 99pl7 or later.

Version 1.6.14 provides 8 bit character  support.  All characters in the
range 128 ...  255 are treated as   lowercase letters.  op/3 is fixed to
actually delete operators when priority 0 is specified.

Version 1.6.13 implements  standard  order   compatible  to  Quintus and
contains  a  fix  of  the  module  system  which  broke  the  Quintus.pl
replacement of retractall/1.

Version 1.6.12 is te result of  integrating   ports  to  LINUX, OS/2 and
HP/UX with the main-stream (SunOs).
