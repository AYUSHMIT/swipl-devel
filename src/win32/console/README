Purpose
=======

The `readline console'  provides  a   simple,  but  reasonable  powerful
console window for running standard I/O based applications that may wish
to access Windows functions.

The console window is inspired by both the X11 xterm application and the
GNU readline library.  The  text  is   buffered  to  provide  for window
resizing and scroll-back. When reading  input   by  line,  an Emacs like
editor is provided for editing  the  input   line.  Old  input lines are
remembered and used by the history system.

==============

The following edit functions are provided:

	Control-A	Beginning of line
	Control-B	Character backward
	Control-C	Generate interrupt
	Control-D	Delete character forwards, or end-of-file

	Control-I (TAB)	Complete (filename, may be programmed)
