SWI-Prolog 5.2.5/XPCE 6.2.5 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.4
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Serious bug using \+ inside ; or if-then-else causing undefined behaviour
    (crash/loop/wrong result).

  * Fixed memory leak in creating and destroying streams.  This notably
    affects sformat/3, swritef/3, atom_to_term/3 and similar predicates
    that create a temporary stream and may be called very frequently.
    Affects MS-Windows version, not Linux.  Other platforms may be affected.

  * Fixed deadlock in see/1 if the file does not exist.

  * Portability issues: platforms that do not support the profiler, platforms
    that require the stack-shifter.  Fixed Solaris detection of profiler
    capabilities.

Packages
--------

  * XPCE: fix to process->close (could crash in Unix/X11 version).

Development environment
-----------------------

  * Improved exception handling in the graphical debugger.

  * Fixed some minor problems


INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

  (none)
