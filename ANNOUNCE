SWI-Prolog 5.2.7/XPCE 6.2.7 stable release

Status
======
  
  * Stable release integrating shared-database multi-threaded execution.

Brief summary of changes since 5.2.6
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Bug in compilation of \+ inside ;.  Under complicated conditions it
    can lead to data corruption that can crash the garbage collector and
    source-level debugger.

  * Bugfix in thread_local dynamic predicates (multi-threaded applications)
    No real bug, but automatic indexing fails, leaving predicates unindexed.

  * Bugfix in exception handling that sometimes crashes the debugger.

  * The usual small and/or obscure stuff.

Packages
--------

  * XPCE: Various minor improvements. Notably affecting trees,
    library(tabular), library(dragdrop).

  * Semweb: various improvements, notably in rdf_edit.pl (transaction and
    undo management).  Also duplicate handling in rdf_db.

  * SGML: fixed memory leak.
