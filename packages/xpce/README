Contents

This directory contains XPCE, an   object-oriented  symbolic programming
environment   for   User   Interfaces.   XPCE   was   designed   to   be
language-independant. In practice it has   gained popularity with Prolog
and many useful libraries are now   available for Prolog only. Therefore
we will often talk about XPCE/Prolog.


Authors

The development of XPCE was started by Anjo Anjewierden. The package was
then called PCE. He designed and implemented  version 1 and 2. Version 3
is  the  result  of  a  joint  effort  from  Anjo  Anjewierden  and  Jan
Wielemaker. This was the last version based  on SunView. Version 4 and 5
have been designed and implemented by Jan  Wielemaker. It makes the full
object oriented mechanisms  underlying  PCE   available  to  the  Prolog
programmer and has bindings for X-windows (X11) and MS-Windows (Win32).
