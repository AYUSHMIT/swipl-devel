C-extension   can  either  be   loaded  through the   foreign language
interface  implemented   by   load_foreign/[1,2,5]  or  through static
linking.  The latter  mechanism  is  to be  used if  the first is  not
ported to your machine/operating system.  Static linking is also to be
preferred  for large   applications   as  it  puts  the   text  in the
text-section of the (unix) process rather  than te  data section.  The
text-section  of  a  process  is  normally write-protected  (providing
better protection) and shared between multiple copies of the program.

To create a statically linked executable, perform the following steps:

  1) Make the file `pl.o' containing all of SWI-Prolog using
     `make pl.o' in the machine-directory and install it.
  2) Make a copy of this file.  In this copy:
  3) Put the right #include directives
  4) Fill the table below.  
  5) Link pl.o with this file and the .o files defining your application.

If there are prolog parts involved:

  6) Start the image; load the prolog and create a state using
     save_program/2.
